<file name=0 path=/Users/jcandersonucb/Documents/GitHub/cloning-tutorials/apps-script/.claspignore># This file specifies files and directories to exclude when using clasp commands.
# It helps keep deployments clean by ignoring unnecessary or sensitive files.

# Only required at the clasp project root (same folder as .clasp.json)
# Since rootDir=src, clasp will only push files inside ./src by default.

# Common local and development files to exclude from push/pull packaging
