The two strands are held together by base pairing: Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G). These fundamental properties allow for key sequence operations like reversing and complementing strands.

During Replication, an exact copy of DNA is produced. During Transcription, a region of DNA is read into RNA. During Translation, a region of RNA (an mRNA or messenger RNA) is read into protein.
