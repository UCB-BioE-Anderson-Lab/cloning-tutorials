# About the SynBio Project Tutorials

This site is a modular training platform for synthetic biology, covering wetlab techniques, design strategies, and project management workflows. It includes a growing suite of tools that run entirely in your browser. These tools work offline and keep all data local, supporting sequence analysis, cloning design, and experimental planning. The tutorials replace and extend earlier material hosted at [OpenWetWare](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Arking:JCAOligoTutorialHome), which remains available for reference.

These tutorials teach the practical and conceptual foundations of synthetic biology, with a focus on modular DNA assembly and project-based learning. The material is modular but intended to be followed sequentially.

## Who This Is For

This tutorial is for anyone who wants to learn how to design and carry out recombinant DNA experiments — the technical core of synthetic biology. It focuses on foundational concepts and practical skills for *in vitro* DNA cloning workflows. Genome editing methods like CRISPR are not covered (currently).

The content is:

- Aimed at students, including those in BioE 140L at UC Berkeley and participants in iGEM@Berkeley and DeCal programs  
- Helpful for post-baccalaureate researchers, educators, and independent learners looking for a practical, modular guide  
- Designed for those with prior coursework in organic chemistry and biochemistry, but no hands-on cloning experience

The site is freely accessible, fully open-source, and suitable for both classroom use and self-paced learning.

## Structure and Use

The content is organized into three parts:

- **Part A: Wetlab** — hands-on PCR, gels, cleanup, assembly, and transformation using the pP6 promoter library
- **Part B: Cloning Techniques** — design and simulation of primers and cloning strategies using tools like Benchling and ApE
- **Part C: Planning** — project-level strategies including combinatorial design, pathway engineering, and illustrative examples of biosynthetic applications.

Tutorials combine written guides, video walkthroughs, and interactive tools. They are intended to be executed in real labs, with troubleshooting and iteration encouraged.

## Project Background

This resource was created by  

**Prof. J. Christopher Anderson**  
Department of Bioengineering, UC Berkeley  
Email: jcanderson@berkeley.edu

It builds on over 15 years of training experience in synthetic biology. ChatGPT was used in planning, drafting, coding, and refining the material through extensive discussion.
