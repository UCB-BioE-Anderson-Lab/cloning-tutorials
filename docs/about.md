# About This Tutorial

This site provides a modernized training resource for DNA cloning workflows. It replaces and extends material previously hosted at [OpenWetWare](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Arking:JCAOligoTutorialHome), which remains available for reference.

These tutorials are designed to teach practical and conceptual foundations for synthetic biology and molecular cloning. The material is modular but intended to be followed sequentially.

---

## Who This Is For

These tutorials support:

- Students in BioE 140L (Synthetic Biology Lab) at UC Berkeley
- Members of iGEM@Berkeley and DeCal student-led programs
- Post-baccalaureate researchers and independent learners

They assume prior coursework in organic chemistry and biochemistry, but no prior hands-on experience in cloning.

## Structure and Use

The content is organized into three parts:

- **Part A: Wetlab** — hands-on PCR, gels, cleanup, assembly, and transformation using the pP6 promoter library
- **Part B: Construction** — design and simulation of primers and cloning plans using tools like Benchling and ApE
- **Part C: Planning** — project-level strategies including combinatorial design, pathway engineering, and real-world examples like lycopene biosynthesis

Tutorials combine written guides, video walkthroughs, and interactive tools. They are intended to be executed in real labs, with troubleshooting and iteration encouraged.

## Project Background

This resource was created by  

**Prof. J. Christopher Anderson**  
Department of Bioengineering, UC Berkeley  
Email: jcanderson@berkeley.edu

It builds on over 15 years of training experience in synthetic biology. The site is actively maintained and updated as methods evolve.
