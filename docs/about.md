# About This Tutorial

This site provides a modernized training resource for DNA cloning workflows. It replaces and extends material previously hosted at [OpenWetWare](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Arking:JCAOligoTutorialHome), which remains available for reference.

These tutorials are designed to teach practical and conceptual foundations for synthetic biology and molecular cloning. The material is modular but intended to be followed sequentially.

## Who This Is For

This tutorial is for anyone who wants to learn how to design and carry out DNA cloning experiments — the technical core of synthetic biology. It focuses on the foundational concepts and practical skills needed to plan and execute cloning workflows, without covering genome editing methods such as CRISPR.

The content is:

- Aimed at students, including those in BioE 140L at UC Berkeley and participants in iGEM@Berkeley and DeCal programs  
- Helpful for post-baccalaureate researchers, educators, and independent learners looking for a practical, modular guide  
- Designed for those with prior coursework in organic chemistry and biochemistry, but no hands-on cloning experience

The site is freely accessible, fully open-source, and suitable for both classroom use and self-paced learning.

## Structure and Use

The content is organized into three parts:

- **Part A: Wetlab** — hands-on PCR, gels, cleanup, assembly, and transformation using the pP6 promoter library
- **Part B: Construction** — design and simulation of primers and cloning plans using tools like Benchling and ApE
- **Part C: Planning** — project-level strategies including combinatorial design, pathway engineering, and real-world examples like lycopene biosynthesis

Tutorials combine written guides, video walkthroughs, and interactive tools. They are intended to be executed in real labs, with troubleshooting and iteration encouraged.

## Project Background

This resource was created by  

**Prof. J. Christopher Anderson**  
Department of Bioengineering, UC Berkeley  
Email: jcanderson@berkeley.edu

It builds on over 15 years of training experience in synthetic biology. The site is actively maintained and updated as methods evolve.
