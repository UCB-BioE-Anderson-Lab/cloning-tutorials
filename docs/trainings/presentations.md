# Engineering a Scientific Presentation

This tutorial guides you through a structured approach to creating a presentation for a project.

## 1) One idea per slide
This single rule defines your entire approach. Every slide should express one idea. You should be able to summarize it in one simple sentence. When you draft your talk, start by writing those sentences first, each one representing a slide. Then examine how they connect into a full narrative.

The first step is to just write. Don’t worry about slides or structure—just free write or talk through your story. Imagine you’re explaining it to a person, or even to an AI, and capture every idea as it comes. You can even turn on a transcription service to record you answering the question "Tell me about your project".

Once you have a rough narrative, start breaking it apart into individual points. You can think of these as the raw material for slides. You rewrite each sentence of your verbal narrative as a simplified bullet.

At this stage, it’s normal to have too much. That’s fine. Go through what you wrote and separate it into many small statements with each expressing one idea. Later, you’ll group, merge, or trim them down to find the right level of granularity for your talk.

The goal is to end up with a sequence of ideas that each stand alone, but also build naturally into a coherent story. Those individual ideas become your slides.

## 2) Identify your audience and their baseline understanding
Before you can communicate effectively, you must know what your audience already knows.

**Example:**
Let’s say you want to explain pP6 to people with one year of college science background. Assume they understand high-school level chemistry and biology, but may not have mastered them. They likely know replication, transcription, and translation at a basic level but nothing more specific.

If you are presenting to professors, you might assume more. But for a student presentation to peers, always build from familiar concepts. Your narrative should connect every new idea to something they already understand.

For *pP6*, you might need slides that introduce:

- Promoter strength and structure
- Synthetic promoters and why they matter
- Degenerate oligos and library design
- Screening approaches and data interpretation

Each of these ideas can be expressed as a clear sentence, then turned into one slide.

## 3) Identify the granularity of the story
Start with a verbose sentences.

**Example draft bullets:**
- Every gene starts with a promoter and they have different strengths.
- Strength relates to the -35 and -10 sequences and their spacing.
- Families like J23119 capture that variation.
- We want to make more promoters like these.
- We can build a synthetic library using degenerate oligos.
- That requires EIPCR and a GFP reporter.
- We screen colonies for brightness.

That’s your raw material. Next, prune it.

Estimate one to two minutes per slide. If you have six minutes, aim for three content slides. Combine related bullets into higher-level ideas:

1. Promoter variation and why we want stronger parts.
2. Building a synthetic promoter library and how it’s made.
3. Screening and finding new strong promoters.

## 4) Making the slides
Students almost always include too much text. It feels safer, but it makes communication harder. Your audience reads instead of listens, and you end up reading your own slides.

**Better approach:**
- Use visuals: cartoons, data, workflows, or photos that you can narrate.
- One idea per slide; state it succinctly in the title.
- Use text sparingly—only to anchor the idea.
- Avoid complete sentences unless quoting or defining.

If you must use bullet slides, ensure each bullet is essential. But for science storytelling, visual explanation almost always works better.

## 5) Narrate your slides
You should not need a script while presenting, but writing one during preparation helps.

Use the slide notes section to write out how you’ll explain each slide. Read these notes before the presentation to reinforce the flow. Don't memorize them, just reconstitute your understanding of the idea in your mind.

Writing the narration:

- Forces you to think through the logic of each slide.
- Helps you recall transitions between ideas.
- Serves as a study or reference aid later.

When presenting, don’t read. You’ll naturally phrase things differently, and that’s fine. The goal is to internalize the story so you can talk through it conversationally.
