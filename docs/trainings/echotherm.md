The EchoTherm dry bath provides two independently controlled plates for chilling and heating samples. It is primarily used for heat shock protocols, allowing precise temperature control on each plate.

## Access

No additional certification or supervisor approval is required to use the EchoTherm. Anyone with lab_safety certification may operate this instrument.

## Default Use

The main role of the EchoTherm is for heat shock procedures.

- Flip the toggle switch on (located at the back right corner).
- Wait until the display temperatures match the setpoints: 4 째C for the front plate and 42 째C for the back plate.
- The default settings are already programmed.

## Adjusting Temperatures

It is acceptable to change the temperature settings for other tasks; however, users must reset the plates to 4 째C (front) and 42 째C (back) when finished.

- An arrow on the display indicates which plate is currently selected.
