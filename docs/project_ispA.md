# Ortholog Scan Project — *ispA*

In this capstone exercise, you will design and plan an ortholog scan for *ispA*, a key gene in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. This gene is more complex than earlier examples and presents opportunities for deeper thought in cloning design, codon optimization, and expression tuning.

## Objectives

- Identify and retrieve orthologs of *ispA* from diverse organisms.
- Plan a cloning strategy to build an expression panel for the orthologs.
- Simulate expression and anticipate challenges (e.g. toxicity, solubility).
- Document your plan using labsheets, Construction Files, and GenBank annotations.

## Requirements

Your submission should include:

- A short rationale for ortholog selection (phylogenetic diversity, expression precedent, etc.).
- A Construction File or set of Construction Files covering all planned builds.
- Labsheet entries describing planned experiments.
- Annotated GenBank (or JSON) records for each design.
- A brief summary explaining your overall strategy and expectations.

## Tips

- Consider using tools like BLAST and UniProt for ortholog selection.
- Simulate assemblies using CFS and/or C6 Tools.
- Think through compatibility with your vector and host system.
- If *ispA* is toxic or difficult to express, plan accordingly.

## Deliverables

Upload or submit:
- Construction Files
- Annotated sequence files
- A PDF or Markdown summary of your rationale and design overview

This final project is your opportunity to apply everything you've learned—from design principles to simulation and documentation—in a real-world cloning context.
