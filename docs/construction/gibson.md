# Gibson Assembly: Building pET-lacZ Without Restriction Enzymes

## Context: Why Gibson?

Traditional cloning methods using restriction enzymes can be limiting. Youâ€™re constrained to placing junctions where restriction sites exist, and adding scars to your constructs. Gibson Assembly solves both of these problems:

1. **Simplicity** â€“ Just PCR and mix. It allows fast cloning without special enzymes for each junction.
2. **Flexibility** â€“ Junctions can be placed anywhere by designing overlaps into your primers.
3. **Scarless** â€“ The overlaps are built into the final product seamlessly.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll use Gibson Assembly to build the same pET-lacZ plasmid from the basic cloning tutorial. But this time, weâ€™ll use PCR to generate two overlapping fragments:
- One containing the *lacZ* gene
- One with the pET28a backbone

Then youâ€™ll join them using Gibsonâ€™s exonuclease-polymerase-ligase mix.

## Step 1: Define the Desired Product
Start by constructing a model of the final pET-lacZ plasmid in your editor.

1. Open the pET vector and convert it to all **lowercase**.
2. Open the *lacZ* genomic region and convert it to **UPPERCASE**.
3. Insert the *lacZ* sequence into the pET vector at the intended location.

This visually marks the junctions between insert and backbone.

## Step 2: Annotate Homology Junctions
1. Highlight the 5' and 3' annealing regions on *lacZ* (the bases you want oligos to bind to).
2. From the adjacent vector sequence, select 20 bp on each side of those junctions.
3. Color these vector sequences.

These highlighted regions form the **homology arms**.

## Step 3: Design Oligos
Each fragment will be amplified using two oligos:
- One matches the gene (or vector) end and includes the homology to the other fragment.
- These overlaps appear as 5' tails on the oligos.

Each oligo has two parts:
- **Annealing region**: The part that binds the template DNA (~20â€“25 bp)
- **Overlap tail**: The part that provides homology to the *other* fragment (~20â€“30 bp)

For example:
- `gib_lacZ_F`: overlap = last 25 bp of pET28a, anneal = first 25 bp of *lacZ*
- `gib_vec_R`: overlap = last 25 bp of *lacZ*, anneal = reverse complement of pET28a flank

Use these pieces to design each full oligo.

oligo   gib_vec_F     ?

```

There are 4 oligos and 2 templates. Replace `?` with final sequences once overlaps are chosen.

## Step 4: Simulate the Design
Use tools (ApE, Benchling) or manual simulation:

- Predict each PCR product by replacing annealing regions with full oligos.
- Simulate the Gibson by trimming overlaps and joining.
- Confirm that the final sequence matches the intended pET-lacZ plasmid.

## How to Simulate a Gibson Assembly

To simulate the Gibson step manually:

1. **Start with your two PCR products**. These contain the sequences produced from oligos with tails.
2. **Align the overlaps**: Look at the 5' and 3' ends. They should share an exact 20â€“40 bp sequence with the the other.
3. **Trim the overlap from one side**: Delete one copy of the overlap so it doesnâ€™t appear twice.
4. **Join the trimmed fragments**: The remaining sequence becomes your final assembled product.

You can do this in any sequence editor:
- Paste both PCR product sequences into a file
- Highlight the overlap
- Delete one copy
- Verify the result matches your intended plasmid

If using a simulation tool like ApE, you can copy-paste and inspect the resulting construct.

## Quiz

Repeat this process for the *groEL* gene:
- Clone *groEL* from *E. coli* genomic DNA into the same pET vector.
- Design overlaps and write the 4 oligos.
- Write a Gibson-format construction file for the assembly.
