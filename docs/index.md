# Synthetic Biology Project Tutorials

Welcome to the **Synthetic Biology Project Tutorials**, a modular series of interactive guides covering both hands-on molecular cloning and high-level project planning. These tutorials build from DNA fundamentals to advanced techniques in cloning design, sequence analysis, experimental execution, and data management.

## Part A: Cloning Techniques

1. **[DNA Basics](dna_basics.md)**  
   Learn about DNA structure, reverse complement operations, strandedness, plasmids, and genomes.

2. **[Sequence Editing Tools](sequence_tools.md)**  
   Learn to use a sequence editor (ApE, Benchling, or other tools) for finding subsequences, reverse complementing, and translating DNA.

3. **[PCR Product Prediction](pcr_prediction.md)**  
   Manually predict PCR products using a sequence editor and understand the concept of annealing regions.

4. **[Construction File Simulation](cf_simulation.md)**  
   Use simulation tools to test cloning steps written in Construction File shorthand.

5. **[Basic Cloning](basic_cloning.md)**  
   Walk through traditional cloning steps.

6. **[Gibson Assembly](gibson.md)**  
   Introduction to Gibson Assembly for seamless cloning.

7. **[Golden Gate Cloning](golden_gate.md)**  
   Learn Golden Gate cloning methods.

8. **[Short Parts Construction](short_parts.md)**  
   Constructing and designing short parts and mutagenesis.

9. **[Sequencing Analysis](sequencing.md)**  
   Learn to analyze sequencing results.

## Part B: Project Planning

1. **[Project Setup and Nomenclature](project_setup.md)**  
   Learn how to structure a project, name experiments, and organize your working directory.

2. **[Experimental Design Principles](design_principles.md)**  
   Understand how to think about synthetic biology experiments from the ground up.

3. **[Sequence Retrieval and Analysis](sequence_analysis.md)**  
   Use BLAST and other tools to find, analyze, and align DNA sequences for cloning.

4. **[Choosing a Fabrication Strategy](oligo_design.md)**  
   Design primers and synthetic fragments for amplification and cloning.

5. **[Simulation Tools](cfs_simulation.md)**  
   Simulate your cloning designs using the Java-based CFS tool and the web-based C6 Tools platform.

6. **[Inventory and Labsheets](inventory_labsheets.md)**  
   Organize your physical inventory and use labsheets to plan and document your experiments.

7. **[Ortholog Scan  Project](project_ispA.md)**  
   Design an ortholog scan for the complex gene *ispA* as a capstone project, integrating bioinformatics, cloning strategy, and documentation.

Each tutorial includes **step-by-step instructions, videos, and interactive examples**.
