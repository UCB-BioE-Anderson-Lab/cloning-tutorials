Welcome to the **Synthetic Biology Project Tutorials**, a modular series of interactive guides covering both hands-on molecular cloning and high-level project planning. These tutorials build from DNA fundamentals to advanced techniques in cloning design, sequence analysis, experimental execution, and data management.

## Part A: Wetlab

1. **[wetlab Experiment Introduction](wetlab/intro.md)**  
   Learn the goal of the pP6 library experiment, the concept of consensus promoters, and why randomized promoter libraries are used.

2. **[Pipetting](wetlab/pipetting.md)**  
   Learn how to use a pipette properly, interpret volume markings, and avoid common errors.

3. **[Polymerase Chain Reaction](wetlab/pcr.md)**  
   Instructions for setting up the PCR using degenerate oligos to amplify the pP6 library.

4. **[Gel Electrophoresis](wetlab/gel.md)**  
   Run a gel to verify the PCR product, and interpret results.

5. **[Zymo Cleanup](wetlab/cleanup.md)**  
   Purify the PCR product to prepare it for assembly.

6. **[Assembly](wetlab/assembly.md)**  
   Rejoin ends of the linear DNA to regenerate the plasmid using Golden Gate assembly.

7. **[Transformation](wetlab/transformation.md)**  
   Transform E. coli with your assembled DNA and plate colonies.

8. **[Colony Picking](wetlab/pick.md)**  
   Pick colonies and grow liquid cultures from selected transformants.

9. **[Miniprep](wetlab/miniprep.md)**  
   Purify plasmid DNA from the cultures using a miniprep protocol.

10. **[Sanger Sequencing](wetlab/sequencing.md)**  
    Submit DNA for sequencing and interpret results to identify strong promoter variants.

11. **[Closeout and Documentation](wetlab/closeout.md)**  
    Record experimental outcomes, summarize findings, and archive your work for future use.

## Part B: Cloning Techniques

1. **[DNA Basics](construction/dna_basics.md)**  
   Learn about DNA structure, reverse complement operations, strandedness, plasmids, and genomes.

2. **[Sequence Editing Tools](construction/sequence_tools.md)**  
   Learn to use a sequence editor (ApE, Benchling, or other tools) for finding subsequences, reverse complementing, and translating DNA.

3. **[Manual Product Prediction](construction/manual_prediction.md)**  
   Manually predict PCR products using a sequence editor and understand the concept of annealing regions.

4. **[Simulation Tools](construction/simulation_tools.md)**  
   Use simulation tools to test cloning steps written in Construction File shorthand.

5. **[Basic Cloning](construction/basic_cloning.md)**  
   Walk through traditional cloning steps.

6. **[Gibson Assembly](construction/gibson.md)**  
   Introduction to Gibson Assembly for seamless cloning.

7. **[Golden Gate Cloning](construction/golden_gate.md)**  
   Learn Golden Gate cloning methods.

8. **[BioBricks and Assembly](construction/biobricks.md)**  
   BioBrick parts, part assembly, and other part formats.

9. **[Short Parts Construction](construction/short_parts.md)**  
   Constructing and designing short parts and mutagenesis.  

10. **[Sequencing Analysis](construction/sequencing.md)**  
   Learn to analyze sequencing results.

## Part C: Project Planning

1. **[Project Setup and Nomenclature](planning/project_setup.md)**  
   Learn how to structure a project, name experiments, and organize your working directory.

2. **[Experimental Design Principles](planning/design_principles.md)**  
   Understand how to think about synthetic biology experiments from the ground up.

3. **[Sequence Retrieval and Analysis](planning/sequence_analysis.md)**  
   Use BLAST and other tools to find, analyze, and align DNA sequences for cloning.

4. **[Choosing a Fabrication Strategy](planning/oligo_design.md)**  
   Design primers and synthetic fragments for amplification and cloning.

5. **[Simulation Tools](planning/cfs_simulation.md)**  
   Simulate your cloning designs using the Java-based CFS tool and the web-based C6 Tools platform.

6. **[Inventory and Labsheets](planning/inventory_labsheets.md)**  
   Organize your physical inventory and use labsheets to plan and document your experiments.

7. **[Ortholog Scan  Project](planning/project_ispA.md)**  
   Design an ortholog scan for the complex gene *ispA* as a capstone project, integrating bioinformatics, cloning strategy, and documentation.

Each tutorial includes **step-by-step instructions, videos, and interactive examples**.
