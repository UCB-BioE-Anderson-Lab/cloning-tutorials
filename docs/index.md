# Synthetic Biology Project Tutorials

Welcome to the **Synthetic Biology Project Tutorials**, a modular series of interactive guides covering both hands-on molecular cloning and high-level project planning. These tutorials build from DNA fundamentals to advanced techniques in cloning design, sequence analysis, experimental execution, and data management.

## Part A: Wetlab

1. **[pP6 Experiment Introduction](pp6_intro.md)**  
   Learn the goal of the pP6 library experiment, the concept of consensus promoters, and why randomized promoter libraries are used.

2. **[Pipetting](pp6_pipetting.md)**  
   Learn how to use a pipette properly, interpret volume markings, and avoid common errors.
