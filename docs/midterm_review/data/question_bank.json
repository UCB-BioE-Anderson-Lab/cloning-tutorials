      "explanation": "A truism catches gross errors but cannot verify whether the function\nfound the *correct* protospacer. A validated example uses a real\nexperimental result — the actual protospacer sequence from a published,\nworking CRISPR system — to verify the function's biological logic. If\nthe function extracts the wrong 20-mer (e.g. off-by-one), the truism\nstill passes (it's valid DNA and the right length) but the validated\nexample fails. Validated examples are the \"best evidence short of\nexperimentally testing designs yourself.\"\n"

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Sigma-70 promoters are not defined by one exact sequence but by a\nconsensus pattern with variation at each position (e.g. the -10 box is\n<pre>TATAAT</pre> but functional variants exist). A PWM captures this variation by\nscoring how likely a given sequence is to function as a promoter. An\nexact match for TATAAT alone would miss functional promoters with single\nsubstitutions, and a search for partial matches would produce too many\nfalse positives.

      "choices": {

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Checkers enforce a defined set of domain-specific constraints (no\nforbidden sites, low hairpin count, acceptable CAI, no internal\npromoters). However, gene expression depends on many additional factors:\nmRNA stability and RNase E cleavage, interactions with other cellular\nRNAs, codon context effects, protein folding during translation, and\nresource competition.
