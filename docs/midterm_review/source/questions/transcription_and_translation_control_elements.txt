topic: Understanding how promoter sequence features control transcription initiation rate
question: |
  In E. coli, sigma-70 recognizes conserved promoter elements. A researcher
  mutates the -10 box from <pre>TATAAT</pre> to <pre>TGTAAT</pre> and observes a
  large drop in mRNA production.

  Which explanation best accounts for this result?
choices:
  A: The -10 box is a sigma-factor recognition element for transcription initiation, so mutating it reduces RNA polymerase recruitment/initiation
  B: The -10 box is the ribosome binding site, so mutating it prevents translation
  C: The mutation introduced a premature stop codon in the mRNA
  D: The -10 box controls mRNA degradation rate rather than transcription initiation
answer: A
explanation: |
  The -10 and -35 promoter elements are recognized by sigma factor during
  transcription initiation. Changing the -10 sequence away from the sigma-70
  consensus weakens promoter recognition and reduces transcription initiation,
  which lowers mRNA production.

  Option B confuses promoter DNA with the ribosome binding site in the mRNA.
  Option C is incorrect because the -10 box is upstream of the coding region and
  is not translated. Option D is incorrect because the -10 box is a promoter
  element, not an RNA degradation signal.

difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how base-pair complementarity determines translation initiation strength
question: |
  The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in an mRNA base-pairs with the 3' end of
  16S rRNA in the ribosome. If one synthetic 5' UTR has SD sequence
  <pre>AGGAGG</pre> and another has <pre>AAGAAG</pre>, which construct is expected to
  have the higher translation initiation rate, and why?
choices:
  A: AGGAGG, because it has stronger complementarity to the 16S rRNA anti-SD sequence
  B: AAGAAG, because more A residues form stronger hydrogen bonds
  C: Both will have equal translation rates because only the start codon matters
  D: AGGAGG, because higher GC content always increases expression by stabilizing the full mRNA
answer: A
explanation: |
  Translation initiation in bacteria is strongly influenced by base-pairing
  between the mRNA Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno region of
  16S rRNA. <pre>AGGAGG</pre> provides stronger complementarity than
  <pre>AAGAAG</pre>, so it is expected to recruit ribosomes more effectively.

  Option B is incorrect because A-U base pairs are weaker than G-C base pairs.
  Option C ignores the role of the SD sequence in bacterial translation
  initiation. Option D overgeneralizes GC content and does not identify the key
  mechanism being tested here.

slug: hairpin-occlusion-of-rbs
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how local RNA secondary structure can mask a functional binding site
question: |
  An mRNA has a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence (<pre>AGGAGG</pre>) upstream of a new
  coding sequence. Despite the strong SD, almost no protein is produced. A
  secondary-structure prediction shows a stable hairpin that includes the SD
  region.

  What is the most likely explanation?
choices:
  A: The hairpin sequesters the SD in a double-stranded stem, preventing ribosome binding
  B: The hairpin blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing past the RBS
  C: The hairpin causes the ribosome to translate in the wrong reading frame
  D: The hairpin directly degrades the mRNA before translation can begin
answer: A
explanation: |
  If the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is base-paired within a hairpin stem, it is not
  accessible for pairing with 16S rRNA. Ribosome binding is therefore impaired,
  and translation initiation drops sharply. This is RBS occlusion.

  Option B is incorrect because the mechanism described is translation-initiation
  failure, not transcription blockage. Option C is incorrect because hairpins do
  not by themselves shift the reading frame. Option D is not the best explanation
  for the evidence given, which directly points to occlusion of the SD site.

slug: context-dependent-rbs-performance
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that RBS performance depends on local sequence context
question: |
  A standard BioBrick RBS part is reported to produce high GFP expression. When
  the same RBS is placed upstream of a different gene, expression drops to near
  zero. What is the most plausible explanation?
choices:
  A: The new CDS forms local secondary structure with the RBS region, occluding the Shine-Dalgarno site
  B: The RBS must have mutated during cloning
  C: BioBrick RBS parts only function with GFP
  D: The new gene product is toxic, so the RBS no longer functions
answer: A
explanation: |
  RBS behavior is context-dependent. The sequence at the beginning of the CDS can
  pair with bases in the 5' UTR and create local RNA secondary structure that
  occludes the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or start region, reducing translation
  initiation.

  Option B is possible in principle but is not the most plausible explanation for
  a common, reproducible context effect. Option C is false. Option D describes a
  different biological problem and does not explain why the same RBS performs
  differently across constructs.

slug: sd-spacing-affects-expression
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how spacing between translation control elements affects initiation efficiency
question: |
  An RBS design tool reports that the optimal spacing between the
  Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon (<pre>ATG</pre>) is 7 nucleotides for
  a given system. If a designer accidentally inserts 2 extra bases between the
  SD and the ATG, what is the expected effect?
choices:
  A: Translation initiation rate will decrease because the ribosome is mispositioned relative to the start codon
  B: Translation will be unaffected because the SD sequence itself is unchanged
  C: Transcription will fail because promoter spacing is disrupted
  D: The protein will include two extra amino acids at the N-terminus
answer: A
explanation: |
  The spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon affects how
  the ribosome is positioned for start-codon recognition. Adding 2 extra bases
  can misalign the start codon relative to the ribosome and reduce translation
  initiation efficiency.

  Option B ignores the importance of SD-to-start spacing. Option C confuses
  translation-initiation spacing with promoter architecture. Option D is wrong
  because these extra bases are in the 5' UTR, not necessarily in the coding
  sequence.

slug: secondary-structure-near-start-codon
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying which local sequence region most strongly predicts expression differences
question: |
  In a study of 154 GFP variants with different codon usage but identical
  protein sequences, researchers observed a large range in fluorescence. Which
  sequence region's secondary structure best predicted expression level?
choices:
  A: The region from -4 to +37 relative to the start codon
  B: The full-length mRNA secondary structure
  C: The last 50 bp of the coding sequence near the stop codon
  D: The promoter region from -35 to +1
answer: A
explanation: |
  Expression differences among synonymous variants are often best predicted by
  local RNA structure near the translation start region, especially around the
  RBS and start codon. In this case, the region from approximately -4 to +37 was
  the strongest predictor.

  Option B is less predictive than the local start-region structure in this type
  of dataset. Option C focuses on a region that is not the dominant determinant
  of initiation efficiency. Option D cannot explain the variation because the
  promoter is the same across the constructs.

slug: operon-structure-and-transcription
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how shared transcriptional control affects multiple genes in an operon
question: |
  In an operon design, three genes (A, B, C) are placed under a single promoter
  and a single terminator, and each gene has its own RBS. If the promoter is
  repressed, what happens to expression of genes A, B, and C?
choices:
  A: All three genes lose transcription because they share one promoter
  B: Only gene A is affected because it is closest to the promoter
  C: Gene C is affected first because the terminator blocks it
  D: Each gene is affected independently because each has its own RBS
answer: A
explanation: |
  A single promoter drives transcription of the operon mRNA. If that promoter is
  repressed, the polycistronic transcript is not produced, so none of the genes
  has mRNA available for translation.

  The separate RBS elements allow independent translation initiation from a
  shared transcript, but they do not bypass promoter-level transcriptional
  control. Option B misunderstands operon transcription. Option C misstates
  terminator function. Option D confuses transcriptional and translational
  control.

slug: promoter-vs-rbs-vs-codon-effects
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing which sequence-level control element to modify to tune expression without changing protein identity
question: |
  A designer wants to reduce expression of a protein by about 10-fold without
  changing the protein sequence. Which modification targets the correct level of
  control?
choices:
  A: Replace the RBS with a weaker Shine-Dalgarno sequence
  B: Change the stop codon from <pre>TAA</pre> to <pre>TGA</pre>
  C: Remove the plasmid origin of replication
  D: Add a His-tag to the protein C-terminus
answer: A
explanation: |
  Replacing the RBS with a weaker Shine-Dalgarno sequence directly reduces
  translation initiation efficiency and can lower protein output without changing
  the encoded protein sequence.

  Option B usually preserves termination and does not provide controlled tuning of
  expression. Option C disrupts plasmid maintenance rather than tuning
  expression. Option D changes the protein sequence and violates the design
  constraint.

difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing sequence changes that alter expression level from those that alter protein sequence
question: |
  A Composition specifies that protein X should be expressed in E. coli. An
  engineer creates two constructs with different RBS parts but identical CDS
  sequences. Which statement is true?
choices:
  A: They produce the same protein at different expression levels
  B: They produce different proteins because the RBS is translated
  C: They have different mRNA sequences and different protein sequences
  D: They will have identical expression levels because the CDS is the same
answer: A
explanation: |
  The RBS is located in the 5' UTR and is not translated into protein. Changing
  the RBS changes translation initiation efficiency (and therefore expression
  level), but the protein sequence remains determined by the CDS.

  Option B is incorrect because the RBS is not part of the coding region. Option
  C is only partly correct because the mRNA sequence changes but the protein
  sequence does not. Option D ignores the role of the RBS in controlling
  expression.

slug: construct-parts-interaction
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how control elements and coding sequence interact in a construct
question: |
  A genetic construct has the layout promoter → RBS → CDS → terminator. A
  designer tests 5 different RBS parts with one CDS and observes a 100-fold
  spread in expression. When the same 5 RBS parts are tested with a different
  CDS, the ranking of the RBS parts changes.

  What does this result demonstrate?
choices:
  A: RBS performance depends on downstream CDS context, likely through local RNA secondary structure at the RBS-CDS junction
  B: The CDS modifies the RBS DNA sequence during replication
  C: The ranking change is best explained by day-to-day experimental noise
  D: RBS parts have fixed intrinsic expression levels that are independent of context
answer: A
explanation: |
  If the ranking of RBS parts changes when only the CDS changes, then RBS
  performance is not context-free. A common mechanism is local RNA secondary
  structure involving the RBS and the beginning of the CDS, which changes access
  to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start region.

  Option B proposes an implausible mechanism. Option C does not match the clear,
  systematic context-dependent pattern. Option D is contradicted by the observed
  ranking change.
