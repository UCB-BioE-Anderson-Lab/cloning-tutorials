topic: Understanding how sequence features at defined positions control the rate of a process
question: |
  In E. coli, the sigma-70 factor recognizes two conserved regions in a
  promoter. A researcher mutates the -10 box from <pre>TATAAT</pre> to <pre>TGTAAT</pre> and
  observes a large drop in mRNA production.

  Which explanation best accounts for this result?
choices:
  A: The -10 box is where sigma factor binds to initiate transcription; mutating it reduces RNAP recruitment
  B: The -10 box is the ribosome binding site; mutating it prevents translation
  C: The mutation introduced a premature stop codon in the mRNA
  D: The -10 box controls mRNA degradation rate, not transcription initiation
answer: A
explanation: |
  The -10 box (Pribnow box) and the -35 box are recognized by the sigma
  factor, which recruits RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Changing
  the -10 consensus reduces sigma binding affinity and thus transcription
  rate. Option B confuses promoter elements with the RBS. Option C is
  wrong because the -10 box is upstream of the coding region. Option D
  is incorrect — mRNA degradation is controlled by RNase activity and
  RNA structure, not the -10 box.

difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how complementary base-pairing between two molecules determines interaction strength
question: |
  The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in an mRNA base-pairs with the 3' end
  of 16S rRNA in the ribosome. If a synthetic 5' UTR has the SD sequence
  <pre>AGGAGG</pre>, and another has <pre>AAGAAG</pre>, which construct is expected to have
  higher translation initiation rate, and why?
choices:
  A: AGGAGG, because it has stronger complementarity to the 16S rRNA anti-SD sequence
  B: AAGAAG, because more A residues form stronger hydrogen bonds
  C: Both will have equal translation rates because the start codon is what matters
  D: AGGAGG, because it has higher GC content which stabilizes the mRNA
answer: A
explanation: |
  The anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the 16S rRNA is complementary to
  AGGAGG. Stronger complementarity means more stable base-pairing, which
  recruits the ribosome more effectively. AAGAAG has mismatches at two
  positions, weakening the interaction. Option B is incorrect — A-U pairs
  are actually weaker than G-C pairs. Option C ignores the well-established
  role of the SD in translation initiation. Option D confuses GC content
  of the SD with mRNA stability.

slug: hairpin-occlusion-of-rbs
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how competing molecular interactions can mask a functional site
question: |
  An RBS with a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence (<pre>AGGAGG</pre>) is paired with a
  new coding sequence. Despite the strong SD, almost no protein is produced.
  A secondary structure prediction reveals a stable hairpin that includes
  the SD region.

  What is the most likely explanation?
choices:
  A: The hairpin sequesters the SD in a double-stranded stem, preventing ribosome binding
  B: The hairpin blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing past the RBS
  C: The hairpin causes the ribosome to translate the mRNA in the wrong reading frame
  D: The hairpin degrades the mRNA before it can be translated
answer: A
explanation: |
  When the SD sequence is trapped in a hairpin stem, it is base-paired with
  a nearby complementary region and physically unavailable for pairing with
  the 16S rRNA. The ribosome cannot bind, so translation does not initiate.
  This is "RBS occlusion." Option B is wrong — hairpins downstream of the
  promoter don't block RNAP (terminators require specific structures).
  Option C — hairpins don't shift reading frame. Option D — while RNA
  structure can affect stability, the described mechanism is occlusion of
  the binding site, not degradation.

difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that a component's function depends on its neighbors, not just its own properties
question: |
  A standard BioBrick RBS part is reported to produce high expression of
  GFP. When the same RBS is placed upstream of a different gene, expression
  drops to near zero. What is the most plausible explanation?
choices:
  A: The new CDS sequence forms a hairpin with the RBS, occluding the Shine-Dalgarno site
  B: The RBS has mutated during the cloning process
  C: BioBrick RBS parts only work with GFP
  D: The new gene's protein product is toxic, so the cells cannot grow
answer: A
explanation: |
  RBS function is context-dependent: the sequence immediately downstream
  (the beginning of the CDS) can form secondary structures with the RBS
  region. If the new CDS has a sequence complementary to the SD region, a
  hairpin forms that occludes ribosome binding. This is why "standardized"
  RBS parts work approximately 2/3 of the time — the other 1/3 fail due
  to context effects. Option B is possible but unlikely as the primary
  explanation. Option C is incorrect — RBS parts are general. Option D
  is a different failure mode unrelated to the RBS itself.

slug: sd-spacing-affects-expression
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how spatial relationships between functional elements affect system output
question: |
  An RBS design tool reports that the optimal spacing between the
  Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon (ATG) is 7 nucleotides for
  a given system. If a designer accidentally inserts 2 extra bases between
  the SD and the ATG, what is the expected effect?
choices:
  A: Translation initiation rate will decrease because the ribosome is positioned incorrectly relative to the start codon
  B: Translation will not be affected because the SD sequence itself is unchanged
  C: Transcription will fail because the promoter spacing is disrupted
  D: The protein will be produced but with two extra amino acids at the N-terminus
answer: A
explanation: |
  The spacing between the SD and the start codon determines where the
  ribosome is physically positioned when it scans for the AUG. If the
  spacing is wrong by even 1–2 bases, the ribosome may not be correctly
  aligned with the start codon, reducing or abolishing translation
  initiation. Option B ignores the well-documented importance of spacing.
  Option C confuses RBS spacing with promoter spacing. Option D is wrong
  because the bases between SD and ATG are in the 5' UTR, not the coding
  region.

difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying which region of a sequence has the greatest impact on a measured output
question: |
  In a study of 154 GFP variants with different codon usage but identical
  protein sequences, researchers found a 250-fold range in fluorescence.
  Which sequence region's secondary structure best predicted expression
  level?
choices:
  A: The region from -4 to +37 relative to the start codon
  B: The full-length mRNA secondary structure
  C: The last 50 bp of the coding sequence near the stop codon
  D: The promoter region from -35 to +1
answer: A
explanation: |
  The Plotkin GFP study showed that secondary structure in the region from
  approximately -4 to +37 (spanning the RBS–CDS junction) explained
  roughly 44–57% of expression variation. Full-length mRNA folding energy
  did not significantly correlate with expression. The 3' end of the CDS
  was not predictive. The promoter was identical across all variants, so
  it cannot explain the variation.

slug: operon-structure-and-transcription
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how a structural arrangement implies shared control of multiple components
question: |
  In an operon design, three genes (A, B, C) are placed under a single
  promoter and a single terminator, each with its own RBS. If the
  promoter is repressed, what happens to expression of genes A, B, and C?
choices:
  A: All three genes lose transcription simultaneously because they share one promoter
  B: Only gene A is affected because it is closest to the promoter
  C: Gene C is affected first because the terminator blocks it
  D: Each gene is affected independently because each has its own RBS
answer: A
explanation: |
  In an operon, a single promoter drives transcription of one polycistronic
  mRNA containing all three genes. If the promoter is repressed, no mRNA
  is made for any of the three genes. Individual RBS elements control
  translation initiation of each gene independently, but they cannot
  function without the mRNA that the promoter produces. Option B
  misunderstands polycistronic transcription. Option C confuses terminator
  function. Option D confuses transcriptional and translational control.

difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing which level of control is responsible for an observed change in output
question: |
  A designer wants to reduce expression of a protein by 10-fold without
  changing the protein sequence. Which modification targets the correct
  level of control?
choices:
  A: Replace the RBS with a weaker Shine-Dalgarno sequence
  B: Change the stop codon from TAA to TGA
  C: Remove the origin of replication from the plasmid
  D: Add a His-tag to the protein's C-terminus
answer: A
explanation: |
  The RBS controls translation initiation rate. A weaker SD sequence
  reduces ribosome recruitment, directly lowering protein output without
  altering the protein sequence. Option B changes the stop codon but both
  are valid stops — the effect on expression is minimal. Option C would
  prevent the plasmid from replicating entirely, not modulate expression.
  Option D changes the protein sequence (adds a tag), violating the
  constraint.

topic: Distinguishing which design changes affect information content versus expression level
question: |
  A Composition specifies that protein X should be expressed in E. coli.
  An engineer creates two constructs with different RBS parts but identical
  CDS sequences. Which of the following is true about the two constructs?
choices:
  A: They produce the same protein at different expression levels
  B: They produce different proteins because the RBS is translated
  C: They have different mRNA sequences and different protein sequences
  D: They will have identical expression levels because the CDS is the same
answer: A
explanation: |
  The RBS is in the 5' UTR, upstream of the start codon. It is not
  translated into protein. Changing the RBS alters how efficiently
  ribosomes initiate translation (and changes the mRNA sequence in the
  UTR region), but the protein product is determined solely by the CDS.
  Option B is wrong — the RBS is not part of the open reading frame.
  Option C is half right (mRNA differs) but wrong about protein. Option D
  ignores the established role of RBS strength in determining expression.

slug: construct-parts-interaction
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how parts of an assembly interact rather than function in isolation
question: |
  A genetic construct consists of: promoter → RBS → CDS → terminator.
  A designer tests 5 different RBS parts with the same CDS and finds that
  expression varies by 100-fold. However, when the same 5 RBS parts are
  tested with a different CDS, the ranking of the parts changes.

  What does this result demonstrate?
choices:
  A: RBS performance depends on the downstream CDS context, likely through secondary structure interactions at the RBS–CDS junction
  B: The CDS somehow modifies the RBS DNA sequence during replication
  C: The ranking changed because the two experiments were done on different days
  D: RBS parts have inherent expression levels that are independent of context
answer: A
explanation: |
  The fact that the ranking changes with different CDS proves that RBS
  function is context-dependent. The most established mechanism is
  secondary structure formation between the RBS region and the beginning
  of the CDS, which can occlude the Shine-Dalgarno site to varying
  degrees depending on the CDS sequence. Option B invokes a biologically
  implausible mechanism. Option C attributes the result to noise rather
  than the systematic effect observed. Option D directly contradicts the
  observation.
