slug: transcription-directionality
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how enzyme movement on the template determines product directionality
question: |
  RNA polymerase binds a promoter and begins transcribing a gene. The
  template strand is read 3'->5', and the new RNA is synthesized 5'->3'.

  A student claims the mRNA sequence is identical to the template strand
  because polymerase "copies" the template. What is wrong with this claim?
choices:
  A: The mRNA is complementary to the template strand, not identical to it
  B: The mRNA is identical to the template strand but in the reverse direction
  C: RNA polymerase does not use a template at all and synthesizes RNA randomly
  D: The mRNA is identical to the template strand except that T is replaced by U
answer: A
explanation: |
  RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand that is complementary to the DNA
  template. Base pairing is A-U, T-A, C-G, and G-C. Therefore, the mRNA is not
  identical to the template strand. Instead, it matches the coding
  (non-template) strand sequence, except RNA uses U where DNA uses T. Option D
  describes the relationship between mRNA and the coding strand, not the
  template strand.

slug: coding-vs-template-strand
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing which strand carries the sequence that matches the product versus which strand is read
question: |
  A gene has the following DNA sequence around the start codon:

  <pre>
  5'-...ATGAAACCC...-3'  (coding strand)
  3'-...TACTTTGGG...-5'  (template strand)
  </pre>

  Which strand does RNA polymerase physically read, and what is the mRNA
  sequence for this region?
choices:
  A: It reads the coding strand (5'->3'); mRNA is 5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'
  B: It reads the template strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'
  C: It reads the template strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-UACUUUGGG...-3'
  D: It reads the coding strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-CCCAAAGUA...-3'
answer: B
explanation: |
  RNA polymerase reads the template strand in the 3'->5' direction and
  synthesizes RNA 5'->3'. The RNA is complementary to the template and thus has
  the same sequence as the coding strand except U replaces T, giving
  5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'. Option A gives the correct mRNA sequence but names the
  wrong strand as the one polymerase reads.

slug: uracil-in-rna
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about why molecular differences between DNA and RNA have functional consequences
question: |
  DNA uses thymine (T) while RNA uses uracil (U). Both bases pair with
  adenine. A student asks: "If T and U both pair with A, does it matter which
  one is used?"

  Which answer best explains why the distinction matters biologically?
choices:
  A: U pairs with A more strongly than T does, making RNA more stable than DNA
  B: The cell can use U versus T to distinguish RNA from DNA, which helps support RNA turnover and DNA repair
  C: U cannot form base pairs in double-stranded structures, so RNA must always be single-stranded
  D: T and U are interchangeable, so the difference has no functional significance
answer: B
explanation: |
  T and U differ by a methyl group. That chemical difference matters because it
  helps cells treat RNA and DNA differently. RNA is meant to be transient in
  many contexts (for example mRNA turnover), while DNA is long-term storage.
  Cells also treat uracil in DNA as damage (often arising from cytosine
  deamination) and repair it. Option A is incorrect, and option C is false
  because RNA commonly forms double-stranded regions such as hairpins.

slug: genetic-code-direction
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why a lookup table is structured in one direction and what that implies for the reverse problem
question: |
  The genetic code maps codons to amino acids. A student wants to go in the
  reverse direction: given an amino acid, determine which DNA codon to use. They
  try:

  <python>
  codon = genetic_code[amino_acid]
  </python>

  where genetic_code maps codons to amino acids. This fails. Beyond the coding
  error, why is the reverse problem fundamentally harder?
choices:
  A: Some amino acids have no codon at all
  B: The reverse mapping is one-to-many, so most amino acids have multiple valid codons
  C: The genetic code is only valid in the 5'->3' direction and cannot be reversed conceptually
  D: Amino acids map to codons in a different reading frame than codons map to amino acids
answer: B
explanation: |
  The genetic code is degenerate: many amino acids are encoded by multiple
  synonymous codons. Translation (codon -> amino acid) is many-to-one, so a
  codon lookup gives a single amino acid. Reverse translation (amino acid ->
  codon) is one-to-many, so there is not one uniquely correct answer. Choosing
  among synonymous codons is exactly the codon optimization problem.

slug: start-stop-codon-roles
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing the roles of signals that initiate versus terminate a molecular process
question: |
  A gene's CDS begins with ATG and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).
  A student designs a CDS but accidentally introduces an in-frame TAA codon in
  the middle. The gene is transcribed normally. What happens during
  translation?
choices:
  A: The ribosome skips the internal TAA because stop codons only work at the end of a gene
  B: The ribosome terminates translation at the internal TAA, producing a truncated protein
  C: The internal TAA is read as an amino acid because codon meaning depends on position
  D: Transcription terminates at the internal TAA, so mRNA is not made past that point
answer: B
explanation: |
  During translation, the ribosome reads codons sequentially from the start
  codon. Any in-frame stop codon is interpreted as a stop signal. An internal
  stop codon therefore causes premature termination and yields a truncated
  protein. Option D confuses translation termination with transcription
  termination, which is controlled by transcription terminator sequences, not
  stop codons.

slug: gene-structure-element-order
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how the spatial arrangement of gene elements determines functional sequence of events
question: |
  In E. coli, a gene is organized as:

  <pre>promoter (-35, -10) -> +1 -> 5'UTR (with RBS) -> ATG -> CDS -> stop -> terminator</pre>

  A student moves the RBS to a position after the start codon. The promoter,
  CDS, and terminator are otherwise correct. What is the most likely outcome?
choices:
  A: Transcription fails because the RBS is required for RNA polymerase binding
  B: The mRNA is transcribed, but translation initiation at the intended ATG is disrupted because the RBS must be upstream
  C: Translation still works because bacterial ribosomes ignore RBS position and start at any ATG
  D: The protein is produced normally but in a different reading frame
answer: B
explanation: |
  In bacteria, the ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) must be
  upstream of the start codon so the ribosome can position the start codon
  correctly for initiation. Moving the RBS downstream disrupts initiation at
  the intended ATG. Transcription can still occur because RNA polymerase binds
  the promoter, not the RBS.

slug: replication-vs-transcription-products
difficulty: medium
topic: Comparing two processes that use template-directed synthesis but produce fundamentally different outputs
question: |
  Replication and transcription both use DNA as a template for polymer
  synthesis. A student says: "They are basically the same process, just with a
  different polymerase."

  Which statement best captures the key difference in what each process
  produces?
choices:
  A: Replication duplicates the genome as double-stranded DNA, whereas transcription produces single-stranded RNA copies of selected regions
  B: Replication produces RNA that is later converted to DNA, whereas transcription produces DNA that is later converted to RNA
  C: Replication copies only the coding strand, whereas transcription copies only the template strand
  D: Replication is error-free, whereas transcription always introduces mutations
answer: A
explanation: |
  Replication copies the entire genome to produce new double-stranded DNA
  molecules. Transcription copies specific regions (genes or operons) into
  single-stranded RNA. The products differ in chemistry (DNA vs RNA), scope
  (whole genome vs selected regions), and typical lifespan (genomic storage vs
  often transient RNA molecules).

slug: information-carriers-comparison
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about what each type of biological polymer encodes and why the system uses three rather than one
question: |
  DNA, RNA, and protein all carry biological information, but they serve
  different roles. A student asks: "Why not just use DNA for everything? It is
  stable and stores sequence information."

  What is the strongest answer?
choices:
  A: DNA is well suited for stable information storage, but proteins provide diverse catalytic/structural functions and RNA provides a regulatable intermediate between gene copy number and protein production
  B: RNA and protein exist only because DNA is too expensive for the cell to make in large amounts
  C: Proteins are folded RNA molecules, so the cell effectively uses only two polymers
  D: The three-polymer system persists only because evolution has not optimized it yet
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA is specialized for stable information storage. Proteins, built from 20
  amino acids with diverse chemistries, perform most catalysis and structural
  work. RNA serves as an intermediate whose abundance can be regulated without
  changing DNA copy number, enabling dynamic control of gene expression. The
  system is not redundant: each polymer contributes a distinct functional role.

slug: plasmid-origin-and-marker
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why autonomous genetic elements require both replication and selection functions
question: |
  A minimal plasmid requires at least an origin of replication and a selectable
  marker (for example, an antibiotic resistance gene). A student removes the
  origin to make room for a larger insert, reasoning that the host chromosome's
  origin will replicate the plasmid too.

  What is the most likely outcome after transformation?
choices:
  A: The plasmid is maintained normally because the host origin replicates all DNA in the cell
  B: The plasmid cannot replicate as an independent molecule and is lost as cells divide, so transformants are not stably maintained
  C: The plasmid automatically integrates into the chromosome at the host origin
  D: The host dies immediately because plasmids without origins are intrinsically toxic
answer: B
explanation: |
  A plasmid needs its own origin to be replicated as an independent DNA
  molecule. The chromosomal origin controls chromosome replication, not random
  extra DNA molecules. Without a plasmid origin, the incoming plasmid may exist
  transiently after transformation but is not copied during cell division, so it
  is progressively lost. Selection cannot maintain a plasmid that is not being
  replicated.

slug: polycistronic-mrna-and-operons
difficulty: medium
topic: Connecting gene organization to mRNA structure and understanding what one transcript can encode
question: |
  In E. coli, the lac operon contains three genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA) under one
  promoter. When the operon is induced, RNA polymerase transcribes all three
  genes into a single mRNA molecule.

  How many separate proteins can ribosomes produce from this one mRNA?
choices:
  A: One, because each mRNA can encode only one protein
  B: Three, because each coding region can have its own RBS and start codon for independent initiation
  C: Three, but only after the mRNA is cut into three separate RNAs
  D: It depends on whether all three genes are in the same reading frame
answer: B
explanation: |
  A bacterial polycistronic mRNA can encode multiple proteins. Each coding
  region can have its own ribosome-binding site and start codon, allowing
  ribosomes to initiate translation independently on the same transcript.
  Bacterial translation does not require the mRNA to be cut into separate RNAs
  first. This arrangement supports coordinated expression of functionally
  related genes.
