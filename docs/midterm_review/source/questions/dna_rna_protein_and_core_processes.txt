slug: transcription-directionality
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how enzyme movement on the template determines product directionality
question: |
  RNA polymerase binds to a promoter and begins transcribing a gene. The
  template strand is read 3'->5', and the new RNA is synthesized 5'->3'.

  A student claims that the mRNA sequence is identical to the template strand
  because the polymerase "copies" the template. What is wrong with this claim?
choices:
  A: The mRNA is complementary to the template strand, not identical to it
  B: The mRNA is identical to the template strand but in the reverse direction
  C: RNA polymerase does not use a template at all — it synthesizes RNA randomly
  D: The mRNA is identical to the template strand except that T is replaced by U
answer: A
explanation: |
  RNA polymerase reads the template strand and synthesizes a complementary RNA.
  At each position it pairs A with U, T with A, C with G, and G with C. The
  resulting mRNA is therefore complementary to the template strand and has the
  same sequence as the coding (non-template) strand, except with U replacing T.
  Option D describes the relationship between the mRNA and the coding strand,
  not the template strand — a common source of confusion.

slug: coding-vs-template-strand
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing which strand carries the sequence that matches the product versus which strand is read
question: |
  A gene has the following coding strand sequence in the region around the
  start codon:

  <pre>
  5'-...ATGAAACCC...-3'  (coding strand)
  3'-...TACTTTAGGG...-5'  (template strand)
  </pre>

  Which strand does RNA polymerase physically read, and what is the
  corresponding mRNA sequence for this region?
choices:
  A: It reads the coding strand (5'->3'); mRNA is 5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'
  B: It reads the template strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'
  C: It reads the template strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-UACUUUGGG...-3'
  D: It reads the coding strand (3'->5'); mRNA is 5'-CCCAAAGUA...-3'
answer: B
explanation: |
  RNA polymerase reads the template strand in its 3'->5' direction while
  synthesizing the new RNA 5'->3'. Because the RNA is complementary to the
  template, its sequence matches the coding strand with U substituted for T:
  5'-AUGAAACCC...-3'. Option A gives the correct mRNA but names the wrong
  strand as the template. Option C shows the complement of the coding strand
  in RNA form, which would be the template re-read in the wrong direction.
  Understanding which strand is read versus which strand "looks like" the
  product is essential for interpreting gene annotations.

slug: uracil-in-rna
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about why molecular differences between DNA and RNA have functional consequences
question: |
  DNA uses thymine (T) while RNA uses uracil (U). Both bases pair with
  adenine. A student asks: "If T and U both pair with A, does it matter which
  one is used?"

  Which answer best explains why the distinction matters biologically?
choices:
  A: U pairs with A more strongly than T does, making RNA more stable
  B: The cell uses the presence of U versus T to distinguish RNA from DNA, enabling selective degradation of RNA while preserving DNA
  C: U cannot form base pairs in double-stranded structures, which is why RNA is always single-stranded
  D: T and U are interchangeable; the difference is a historical accident with no functional significance
answer: B
explanation: |
  Although T and U both pair with A, the chemical difference (a single methyl
  group) allows the cell to discriminate between DNA and RNA. Enzymes like
  RNases specifically target RNA for rapid turnover, while DNA repair enzymes
  recognize and remove uracil from DNA (treating it as a damaged cytosine).
  This selective degradation is essential: mRNA must be transient to allow
  regulation, while the genome must be stable. Option A is backwards — the
  methyl group on T actually contributes to DNA stability. Option C is false;
  RNA can and does form double-stranded regions (e.g., hairpins).

slug: genetic-code-direction
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why a lookup table is structured in one direction and what that implies for the reverse problem
question: |
  The genetic code maps 64 codons to 20 amino acids plus stop signals.
  A student wants to go in the reverse direction: given an amino acid,
  determine the DNA codon to use. They try:

  <python>
  codon = genetic_code[amino_acid]
  </python>

  where genetic_code maps codons to amino acids. This fails. But beyond the
  coding error, why is the reverse problem fundamentally harder?
choices:
  A: Some amino acids have no codon at all
  B: The reverse mapping is one-to-many — most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, so there is no single answer
  C: The genetic code is only valid in the 5'->3' direction and cannot be reversed
  D: Amino acids map to codons in a different reading frame
answer: B
explanation: |
  The genetic code is degenerate: most amino acids are encoded by 2, 3, 4, or
  6 different codons. Translation (codon->amino acid) is a many-to-one mapping,
  so the forward lookup always has a unique answer. Reverse translation
  (amino acid->codon) is one-to-many, meaning you must choose among synonymous
  codons. This choice is the basis of codon optimization. Option A is wrong —
  all 20 standard amino acids have at least one codon. Option C confuses
  directionality of reading with the reversibility of the mapping.

slug: start-stop-codon-roles
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing the roles of signals that initiate versus terminate a molecular process
question: |
  A gene's CDS begins with ATG and ends just before a stop codon (TAA, TAG,
  or TGA). A student designs a CDS but accidentally places a TAA codon in
  the middle of the reading frame. The gene is transcribed normally. What is
  the consequence during translation?
choices:
  A: The ribosome skips the internal TAA because stop codons only function at the end of a gene
  B: The ribosome terminates translation at the internal TAA, producing a truncated protein
  C: The internal TAA is read as an amino acid because context determines codon meaning
  D: Transcription terminates at the internal TAA, so no mRNA is produced past that point
answer: B
explanation: |
  The ribosome reads codons sequentially from the start codon. When it
  encounters any in-frame stop codon — UAA in the mRNA — it terminates
  translation and releases the incomplete polypeptide. Stop codons have no
  positional requirement; they function wherever they appear in the reading
  frame. Option A reflects a misconception that stop codons are only
  "active" at designated gene boundaries. Option D confuses translation
  termination with transcription termination, which depends on terminators,
  not stop codons. This is why an accidental frameshift that introduces a
  premature stop codon is so damaging.

slug: gene-structure-element-order
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how the spatial arrangement of gene elements determines functional sequence of events
question: |
  In E. coli, a gene is organized as:

  <pre>promoter (-35, -10) -> +1 -> 5'UTR (with RBS) -> ATG -> CDS -> stop -> terminator</pre>

  A student rearranges the design and places the RBS after the start codon.
  The promoter, CDS, and terminator are correct. What happens?
choices:
  A: Transcription fails because the RBS is required for RNA polymerase binding
  B: The mRNA is made normally, but the ribosome cannot initiate translation at the correct ATG because the RBS must be upstream of the start codon
  C: Translation still works because the ribosome scans for any ATG regardless of RBS position
  D: The protein is produced but in the wrong reading frame
answer: B
explanation: |
  The RBS (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) must be located in the 5'UTR, upstream of
  the start codon, because the ribosome uses it to position itself so that the
  ATG falls in the P site. Moving the RBS downstream of ATG means the ribosome
  has no signal to land near the correct start codon. Transcription is
  unaffected because RNA polymerase uses the promoter, not the RBS. Option A
  confuses the ribosome with RNA polymerase. Option C describes eukaryotic
  scanning, not prokaryotic translation initiation. This illustrates that gene
  elements are not interchangeable — their order reflects the sequence of
  molecular events.

slug: replication-vs-transcription-products
difficulty: medium
topic: Comparing two processes that use template-directed synthesis but produce fundamentally different outputs
question: |
  Both replication and transcription use a DNA template to synthesize a new
  polymer. A student says: "They are basically the same process — one just
  uses a different polymerase."

  Which statement best captures the key difference in what each process
  produces?
choices:
  A: Replication produces two complete double-stranded DNA copies of the entire genome; transcription produces a single-stranded RNA copy of one gene
  B: Replication produces RNA that is later converted to DNA; transcription produces DNA that is later converted to RNA
  C: Replication copies only the coding strand; transcription copies only the template strand
  D: Replication is error-free while transcription always introduces mutations
answer: A
explanation: |
  Replication duplicates the full genome, producing two dsDNA molecules — each
  an exact copy of the original. Transcription selectively copies individual
  genes (or operons) into single-stranded RNA molecules, producing many copies
  of a transient message from one region of the genome. The processes differ in
  scope (whole genome vs. individual genes), product chemistry (DNA vs. RNA),
  and product lifespan (permanent vs. transient). Option C is wrong because
  replication copies both strands. Option D overstates the fidelity difference;
  both processes have error rates, though replication includes proofreading.

slug: information-carriers-comparison
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about what each type of biological polymer encodes and why the system uses three rather than one
question: |
  DNA, RNA, and protein each carry biological information, but they serve
  different roles. A student proposes simplifying the system: "Why not just
  use DNA for everything? It is more stable and can encode information."

  What is the strongest argument for why the cell uses all three?
choices:
  A: DNA cannot fold into functional shapes, so proteins are needed for catalysis and structure while RNA serves as a disposable intermediate whose abundance can be regulated independently of gene copy number
  B: RNA and protein are needed only because DNA is too expensive for the cell to produce in large quantities
  C: Proteins are just folded RNA molecules, so the cell really only uses two information carriers
  D: The three-polymer system exists because evolution has not yet optimized it to use only DNA
answer: A
explanation: |
  Each polymer has distinct capabilities. DNA is optimized for stable, long-term
  storage but has limited catalytic and structural repertoire. Proteins, built
  from 20 chemically diverse amino acids, can fold into enzymes, structural
  elements, and signaling molecules that DNA cannot replicate. RNA serves as a
  regulatable intermediate: the cell can control how many mRNA copies exist
  independently of the single gene in the genome, enabling dynamic responses.
  Option B ignores the functional differences. Option C is biochemically wrong.
  The three-polymer system is not redundant — each step adds a different
  capability.

slug: plasmid-origin-and-marker
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why autonomous genetic elements require both replication and selection functions
question: |
  A minimal plasmid requires at least an origin of replication and a
  selectable marker (e.g., antibiotic resistance gene). A student removes
  the origin of replication to make room for a larger insert, reasoning
  that the host's chromosomal origin will replicate the plasmid too.

  What happens after transformation?
choices:
  A: The plasmid replicates using the host's origin and is maintained normally
  B: The plasmid cannot replicate independently and is diluted out as cells divide, even under antibiotic selection
  C: The plasmid integrates into the chromosome at the host's origin
  D: The host cell cannot survive because plasmids without origins are toxic
answer: B
explanation: |
  A plasmid must carry its own origin of replication to be replicated by the
  host's DNA polymerase as an independent molecule. The chromosomal origin only
  directs replication of the chromosome itself. Without its own origin, the
  plasmid is not copied when the cell divides. It persists briefly in one
  daughter cell but is progressively diluted with each division. Even under
  antibiotic selection, cells that still carry the plasmid are not viable long-
  term because the plasmid copy number drops to zero. Option A reflects a
  misconception that any origin can replicate any DNA in the cell. Option C
  would require homologous sequences, which were not described.

slug: polycistronic-mrna-and-operons
difficulty: medium
topic: Connecting gene organization to mRNA structure and understanding what one transcript can encode
question: |
  In E. coli, the lac operon contains three genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA) under
  a single promoter. When the operon is induced, RNA polymerase transcribes
  all three genes into one mRNA molecule.

  How many separate proteins can the ribosome produce from this single mRNA?
choices:
  A: One — each mRNA can only encode one protein
  B: Three — each gene has its own RBS and start codon within the mRNA, so the ribosome initiates translation independently at each one
  C: Three — but only if the mRNA is first cut into three separate pieces
  D: It depends on the reading frame — all three genes must be in the same frame to be translated
answer: B
explanation: |
  A polycistronic mRNA contains multiple coding sequences, each preceded by its
  own RBS and start codon. Ribosomes in E. coli can initiate translation
  independently at each RBS, producing separate proteins from the same
  transcript. The mRNA does not need to be cut. Option A describes the
  eukaryotic default (monocistronic mRNA), not the prokaryotic case. Option C
  invents a processing step that is not required for bacterial translation.
  Option D is wrong because each gene has its own start codon defining its own
  reading frame — the three CDSs do not need to share a frame. This
  organization allows coordinated expression of functionally related genes.
