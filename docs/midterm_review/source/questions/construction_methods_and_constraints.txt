topic: Understanding why only the primer 3' annealing region must match to initiate PCR synthesis
question: |
  In PCR, a primer is designed with a 20 bp 3' annealing region that matches the
  template and a 15 bp 5' tail that adds a new sequence.

  Why does the 5' tail not need to match the template?
choices:
  A: DNA polymerase extends from the primer's base-paired 3' end, so only the 3' annealing region must match the template to initiate synthesis
  B: The 5' tail is removed by an exonuclease during the first PCR cycle
  C: The 5' tail anneals to the opposite strand of the template during the first cycle
  D: Both ends must match the template, but 5' mismatches are simply tolerated by polymerase
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA polymerase requires a base-paired primer 3' hydroxyl to begin extension.
  The primer's 3' annealing region provides that base-paired starting point. The
  5' tail can remain unmatched in the first cycle and is still copied into the
  product as polymerase extends from the 3' end.

  In later cycles, that tail sequence is present in the PCR product and can serve
  as part of the template. Option B is incorrect because the tail is not removed.
  Option C is incorrect because the tail is not required to anneal elsewhere.
  Option D is incorrect because the 5' tail is not just a tolerated mismatch; it
  is intentionally non-annealing sequence.

topic: Understanding how terminal homology enables fragment joining without restriction sites
question: |
  In Gibson assembly, two DNA fragments are designed with about 20 bp of
  identical sequence at the ends that should connect.

  What is the role of this shared homology?
choices:
  A: After exonuclease creates single-stranded overhangs, the homologous regions anneal and align the fragments for repair and ligation
  B: The homologous regions are recognized by a restriction enzyme that cuts and ligates them
  C: The shared sequence serves as a PCR primer that amplifies the joined product directly in the Gibson reaction
  D: The homology encodes a protein that catalyzes the assembly reaction
answer: A
explanation: |
  In Gibson assembly, exonuclease first exposes complementary single-stranded
  ends, the homologous regions anneal, polymerase fills remaining gaps, and
  ligase seals nicks. The shared terminal homology is what allows adjacent
  fragments to find and pair with the correct partner.

  Option B confuses Gibson assembly with restriction-enzyme cloning. Option C
  confuses Gibson assembly with PCR. Option D is nonsensical.

slug: forbidden-restriction-sites
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing how an assembly method constrains which sequences are allowed in a design
question: |
  A gene synthesis order is rejected because the sequence contains a BsaI
  recognition site (<pre>GGTCTC</pre>). The gene will later be assembled using Golden
  Gate cloning, which uses BsaI.

  Why must the internal site be removed?
choices:
  A: If BsaI cuts at the internal site during assembly, the fragment is split into unintended pieces and the assembly fails or produces incorrect products
  B: BsaI sites slow gene synthesis enough that vendors refuse all such sequences
  C: The sequence <pre>GGTCTC</pre> encodes a toxic peptide when present in a coding region
  D: Restriction sites cannot appear in coding sequences because they inherently block translation
answer: A
explanation: |
  Golden Gate assembly depends on controlled BsaI cutting at intended junctions.
  If the insert also contains an internal BsaI site, the enzyme cuts there too,
  creating extra fragments that disrupt the planned assembly.

  The usual fix is to remove the internal site by synonymous (silent) codon
  changes if the site is in a coding region. Option B is incorrect as stated.
  Option C is false. Option D is false because restriction sites can occur in
  coding sequences without inherently disrupting translation.

topic: Understanding how a structured build plan represents a sequence of physical DNA construction steps
question: |
  A Construction File (CF) contains these steps:

  <pre>
  pcr   fwd1 rev1 pTemplate product1
  digest product1 EcoRI 1 frag1
  ligate frag1 lig1
  transform lig1 Mach1 Amp pFinal
  </pre>

  What does this CF describe?
choices:
  A: A DNA construction workflow that amplifies DNA by PCR, digests it with EcoRI, ligates the product, and transforms it into Mach1 cells with ampicillin selection
  B: A gene expression experiment that transcribes and translates a protein from pTemplate
  C: A sequencing workflow that reads the DNA sequence of pTemplate
  D: A codon optimization workflow that redesigns the coding sequence before synthesis
answer: A
explanation: |
  Each CF line encodes a build step in a cloning workflow. The file specifies a
  PCR step, an EcoRI digest of the PCR product, a ligation step, and a
  transformation into Mach1 cells with ampicillin selection. That is a physical
  DNA construction plan, not an expression, sequencing, or codon-optimization
  workflow.

slug: pcr-product-prediction
difficulty: medium
topic: Tracing the dominant PCR product from primer structure and template matching rules
question: |
  A PCR reaction uses:
  <pre>
  Forward oligo: 5'-AAAA-cccc-3'  (AAAA is a 5' tail; cccc anneals to template)
  Reverse oligo: 5'-TTTT-gggg-3'  (TTTT is a 5' tail; gggg anneals to template)
  Template: 5'-...ccccXXXXXXXXgggg...-3'
  </pre>

  After many PCR cycles, what is the dominant product?
choices:
  A: A double-stranded DNA product bounded by the full primer sequences, including the AAAA and TTTT 5' tails
  B: Only the original template sequence, because 5' primer tails are not copied
  C: Single-stranded DNA matching the forward oligo only
  D: A product containing only the XXXXXXXX internal region with no primer-derived sequence
answer: A
explanation: |
  The primer 3' annealing regions bind the template and are extended by DNA
  polymerase. During the first cycles, the 5' tails become incorporated into the
  newly synthesized strands. In later cycles, those tail-containing products act
  as templates, so the full primer sequences become fixed at the ends of the PCR
  amplicon.

  Therefore the dominant product includes primer-derived tail sequences at both
  ends. Options B, C, and D all ignore how primer sequences become incorporated
  and then re-amplified.

difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how fragment size limits drive divide-and-assemble build strategies
question: |
  A synthesis provider can reliably deliver DNA fragments only up to a few
  kilobases each. A designer needs to build a 15 kb plasmid.

  What is the standard strategy?
choices:
  A: Split the design into multiple fragments with planned overlaps and assemble them using Gibson or a similar multi-fragment method
  B: Request a single 15 kb synthesized fragment as a rush order to bypass the limit
  C: Order thousands of short oligos and assemble the full plasmid directly by PCA in one step
  D: Abandon synthesis and clone the full sequence from a natural organism using restriction enzymes
answer: A
explanation: |
  Large constructs are typically built by dividing the design into buildable
  fragments and then assembling them with methods such as Gibson assembly that
  use defined overlaps. This is the standard engineering response to synthesis
  length limits.

  Option B assumes the limit can simply be bypassed. Option C is not a standard
  one-step strategy for a 15 kb plasmid. Option D assumes the sequence exists in
  nature and ignores the stated design-build workflow.

slug: restriction-digest-and-ligation
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how restriction digest and ligation change DNA ends and topology
question: |
  A linear PCR product has an EcoRI site near each end. After digesting with
  EcoRI and then ligating, what is the expected major product under typical
  dilute ligation conditions?
choices:
  A: A circular DNA formed by intramolecular ligation of the compatible EcoRI sticky ends
  B: Two separate fragments that cannot be rejoined because EcoRI destroys end compatibility
  C: The same linear DNA, unchanged, because ligase cannot act after restriction digestion
  D: A large concatemer made primarily from repeated intermolecular ligation events
answer: A
explanation: |
  EcoRI generates compatible sticky ends (5' overhangs) at both cut sites. After
  digestion, those ends can anneal and be sealed by ligase. For a single fragment
  under typical dilute ligation conditions, intramolecular ligation (circular
  product) is usually favored over intermolecular concatenation.

  Option B is incorrect because EcoRI creates compatible ends. Option C is
  incorrect because ligation after digestion is a standard workflow. Option D can
  occur, especially at higher DNA concentration, but is not typically the major
  product under dilute conditions.

slug: pca-vs-standard-pcr
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing standard PCR amplification from polymerase chain assembly by the inputs provided
question: |
  Standard PCR uses two primers and a separate template DNA to amplify a target
  region. Polymerase Chain Assembly (PCA) instead uses a pool of overlapping
  oligos with no separate full-length template.

  What does PCA produce?
choices:
  A: A gene-length DNA assembled from overlapping oligos that serve as templates and primers for one another during the reaction
  B: Many copies of only the longest oligo in the pool
  C: A random library of all possible oligo combinations with no dominant product
  D: Only single-stranded DNA because no full-length template was provided initially
answer: A
explanation: |
  In PCA, overlapping oligos anneal to one another and are extended by
  polymerase, creating progressively longer fragments across cycles. The reaction
  builds a longer DNA product from the oligo pool, and outer primers are often
  used afterward to amplify the assembled full-length product.

  Option B misunderstands the assembly mechanism. Option C overstates the
  randomness of the process. Option D is wrong because the oligos themselves act
  as templates during assembly.

slug: oligo-design-constraints
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how multiple primer design constraints must be satisfied simultaneously
question: |
  When designing a PCR primer annealing region, several constraints are usually
  considered at the same time. Which set of constraints is most appropriate?
choices:
  A: About 18–25 bp length, moderate GC content, no long homopolymer runs, and a stable 3' end (often a G/C clamp)
  B: Exactly 20 bp length, any GC content, must begin with ATG, and no sequence constraints otherwise
  C: About 50–100 bp length, low GC content, and must end with a stop codon
  D: About 10–15 bp length, very high GC content, and A/T at both ends to improve priming
answer: A
explanation: |
  Primer annealing regions are typically chosen to balance specificity,
  melting/annealing behavior, and robust extension from the 3' end. Common
  design heuristics include roughly 18 to 25 bases, moderate GC content,
  avoiding long homopolymers, and a reasonably stable 3' end (often a G/C-rich
  end).

  Option B confuses primer design with coding-sequence design. Option C is far
  too long and uses inappropriate coding constraints. Option D is generally too
  short and too GC-rich for reliable, specific priming.

slug: design-vs-fabrication-feasibility
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that a sequence can be computationally valid yet difficult to synthesize physically
question: |
  A codon-optimization algorithm produces a 4,000 bp coding sequence. The
  sequence passes software checks (for example, no forbidden restriction sites
  and acceptable codon-usage metrics), but a fabrication engineer flags it as
  difficult to synthesize.

  Which issue could cause that problem?
choices:
  A: A short region with extreme GC content that promotes strong secondary structure in synthesis intermediates and increases synthesis failure risk
  B: High codon diversity across the sequence
  C: The encoded protein is too large for E. coli to express efficiently
  D: The sequence does not end with a transcription terminator
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA synthesis feasibility depends on fabrication constraints that are not the
  same as expression-design constraints. Local regions with extreme GC content,
  repeats, or strong secondary structure can make synthesis and assembly much
  harder even when the sequence is otherwise biologically valid.

  Option B is not a typical synthesis blocker by itself. Option C is an
  expression issue, not a fabrication issue. Option D is a construct-design
  context issue and is not a reason a coding sequence itself would be hard to
  synthesize.
