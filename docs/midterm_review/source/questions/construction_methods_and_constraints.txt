topic: Understanding why only part of a component must match for a process to initiate
question: |
  In PCR, a primer is designed with a 20 bp 3' annealing region that
  matches the template and a 15 bp 5' tail that adds a new sequence.
  Why does the 5' tail not need to match the template?
choices:
  A: DNA polymerase extends only from the 3' end, so only the 3' region needs to base-pair with the template for priming
  B: The 5' tail is removed by an exonuclease during the first PCR cycle
  C: The 5' tail anneals to the opposite strand of the template
  D: Both ends must match the template, but mismatches at the 5' end are tolerated by polymerase
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA polymerase requires a base-paired 3' hydroxyl to begin synthesis.
  The 3' end of the primer anneals to the template and provides this
  substrate. The 5' tail hangs free during the first cycle but becomes
  incorporated into the product, which then serves as a template in
  subsequent cycles. Option B is wrong — the tail is not removed. Option C
  is incorrect — the tail is not designed to anneal anywhere. Option D
  overstates it — the 5' end genuinely does not need to match.

topic: Understanding how shared sequence between fragments enables joining without specific recognition sites
question: |
  In Gibson assembly, two DNA fragments are joined by including ~20 bp
  of identical sequence at the ends that should connect. What is the role
  of this shared homology?
choices:
  A: After T5 exonuclease creates single-stranded overhangs, the homologous regions anneal to join the fragments
  B: The homologous regions are recognized by a restriction enzyme that cuts and ligates them
  C: The shared sequence serves as a primer for PCR amplification of the joined product
  D: The homology encodes a protein that catalyzes the assembly reaction
answer: A
explanation: |
  Gibson assembly works by: (1) T5 exonuclease chews back 5' ends to
  expose single-stranded overhangs, (2) complementary homologous regions
  on adjacent fragments anneal, (3) polymerase fills gaps, and (4) ligase
  seals nicks. The shared homology is essential for the annealing step —
  without it, fragments cannot find their correct partners. Option B
  confuses Gibson with restriction/ligation cloning. Option C confuses
  Gibson with PCR. Option D is nonsensical.

slug: forbidden-restriction-sites
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing how a downstream process constrains what sequences are allowed in a design
question: |
  A gene synthesis order is rejected because the sequence contains a BsaI
  recognition site (<pre>GGTCTC</pre>). The gene will later be assembled using Golden
  Gate cloning, which requires BsaI. Why must the internal site be removed?
choices:
  A: If BsaI cuts at the internal site during assembly, the fragment will be split into unintended pieces, ruining the assembly
  B: BsaI sites slow down gene synthesis and increase cost
  C: The GGTCTC sequence encodes a toxic peptide that kills the host cell
  D: Restriction sites cannot appear in coding sequences because they disrupt translation
answer: A
explanation: |
  Golden Gate cloning uses BsaI to cut DNA at defined positions for
  assembly. If BsaI also cuts internally within the gene, it generates
  extra fragments that participate incorrectly in the assembly, producing
  the wrong product. The site must be removed by silent codon changes
  that preserve the protein sequence. Option B is incorrect — synthesis
  companies can make any sequence, though some flag problematic sites.
  Option C is wrong — GGTCTC does not inherently encode anything toxic.
  Option D is wrong — restriction sites in coding regions are normal and
  do not affect translation.

topic: Understanding how a structured representation captures an experiment as a sequence of operations
question: |
  A Construction File (CF) contains these steps:

  <pre>
  pcr   fwd1 rev1 pTemplate product1
  digest product1 EcoRI 1 frag1
  ligate frag1 lig1
  transform lig1 Mach1 Amp pFinal
  </pre>

  What does this CF describe?
choices:
  A: A cloning experiment that amplifies DNA by PCR, cuts it with a restriction enzyme, ligates it into a circle, and transforms it into cells
  B: A gene expression experiment that transcribes and translates a protein
  C: A sequencing protocol that reads the DNA sequence of pTemplate
  D: A codon optimization workflow that redesigns the coding sequence
answer: A
explanation: |
  Each line of a CF is a step in a DNA construction experiment. The PCR
  step amplifies a region using two oligos and a template. Digest cuts the
  product with EcoRI. Ligate joins the ends. Transform introduces the
  ligated DNA into Mach1 cells with ampicillin selection. This is a
  standard cloning workflow. The CF is a domain-specific representation
  of the physical experiment, not a computational pipeline.

topic: Tracing the output of a process given its inputs and rules
question: |
  A PCR reaction uses:
  <pre>
  Forward oligo: 5'-AAAA-cccc-3'  (AAAA is 5' tail, cccc anneals to template)
  Reverse oligo: 5'-TTTT-gggg-3'  (TTTT is 5' tail, gggg anneals to template)
  Template: 5'-...ccccXXXXXXXXcccc...-3' (cccc regions match oligos)
  </pre>

  After 30 cycles, what is the dominant product?
choices:
  A: A double-stranded DNA with AAAA on one end, TTTT on the other, and the template region plus tails in between
  B: Only the original template sequence with no modifications
  C: Single-stranded DNA matching the forward oligo sequence
  D: A product containing only the XXXXXXXX region with no oligo sequences
answer: A
explanation: |
  In the first cycle, each primer's 3' end anneals to the template and
  polymerase extends, incorporating the 5' tails. In subsequent cycles,
  the extended products become templates themselves, so the tails are
  now part of the template. After ~30 cycles, the dominant product is a
  double-stranded DNA bounded by the full oligo sequences including their
  5' tails. This is how PCR adds synthetic sequence to ends of a natural
  template.

question: |
  Gene synthesis companies can reliably produce fragments up to ~5,000 bp.
  A designer needs to build a 15,000 bp plasmid. What is the standard
  approach?
choices:
  A: Order three ~5 kb fragments with overlapping ends and assemble them using Gibson or similar method
  B: Order one 15 kb fragment, since special rush orders can exceed the limit
  C: Order 15,000 individual oligos and assemble them directly by PCA
  D: Clone the 15 kb sequence from a natural organism using restriction enzymes
answer: A
explanation: |
  Current gene synthesis technology is limited to ~3–5 kb per fragment due
  to error accumulation. Longer constructs are built by assembling multiple
  verified fragments using methods like Gibson assembly, which requires
  ~20 bp overlaps between adjacent fragments. Option B exceeds the
  technological limit. Option C is impractical — PCA from oligos works
  for ~600 bp, not 15 kb. Option D assumes the sequence exists naturally,
  which it likely does not for a synthetic design.

slug: restriction-digest-and-ligation
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how specific cutting and joining operations transform DNA topology
question: |
  A linear PCR product has an EcoRI site near each end. After digesting
  with EcoRI and then ligating, what is the expected product?
choices:
  A: A circular DNA formed by ligation of the compatible sticky ends generated by EcoRI at both ends
  B: Two separate fragments that cannot be joined
  C: The same linear DNA, unchanged by the enzymes
  D: A larger DNA formed by concatenation of multiple copies of the fragment
answer: A
explanation: |
  EcoRI cuts at <pre>GAATTC</pre> to produce compatible 4-base sticky ends (5'-AATT
  overhangs). When the same enzyme cuts both ends of a linear fragment,
  the two ends have complementary overhangs that can anneal and be sealed
  by ligase, forming a circle. This is the basis of EIPCR-based cloning.
  Option B is wrong because the ends are compatible. Option C ignores that
  digestion removes bases to create overhangs. Option D can happen at high
  DNA concentration but the dominant intramolecular product is a circle.

slug: pca-vs-standard-pcr
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing how the same core mechanism produces different outcomes with different inputs
question: |
  Standard PCR uses two primers and a single template to amplify a
  specific region. Polymerase Chain Assembly (PCA) uses a pool of
  overlapping oligos with no separate template. What does PCA produce?
choices:
  A: A gene-length DNA assembled from the overlapping oligos, which serve as both templates and primers for each other
  B: Many copies of the longest oligo in the pool
  C: A random library of all possible combinations of the oligos
  D: Single-stranded DNA because there is no template to copy
answer: A
explanation: |
  In PCA, overlapping oligos anneal to each other at their complementary
  regions and are extended by polymerase. Through successive cycles of
  denaturation, annealing, and extension, progressively longer fragments
  are built. Outer primers then amplify the full-length product. This is
  how gene-length DNA (~600 bp) can be assembled from short oligos
  (~40–60 bp each). Option B misunderstands the assembly mechanism.
  Option C overstates the randomness. Option D is wrong because the
  oligos serve as templates for each other.

slug: oligo-design-constraints
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how multiple physical constraints simultaneously restrict a design choice
question: |
  When designing a PCR primer's annealing region, several constraints must
  be satisfied simultaneously. Which set of constraints is correct?
choices:
  A: 18–25 bp length, 50–65% GC content, G or C at the 3' end, no long homopolymeric runs
  B: Exactly 20 bp length, any GC content, must start with ATG, no constraints on sequence
  C: 50–100 bp length, 30–40% GC content, must end with a stop codon
  D: 10–15 bp length, 80% GC content, A or T at both ends
answer: A
explanation: |
  Primer annealing regions are typically 18–25 bp to ensure specificity.
  GC content of 50–65% provides appropriate melting temperature. A G or C
  at the 3' end (GC clamp) stabilizes binding at the critical end where
  polymerase initiates. Homopolymeric runs cause mispriming. Option B has
  wrong constraints and confuses primer design with CDS design (ATG is a
  start codon). Option C describes something far too long with wrong GC
  range. Option D is too short and too GC-rich.

slug: design-vs-fabrication-feasibility
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that a computationally valid design may be physically impossible to build
question: |
  A codon optimization algorithm produces a 4,000 bp coding sequence.
  The sequence passes all checks — no forbidden restriction sites, good
  CAI, no hairpins. However, a fabrication engineer flags a problem.

  Which issue could make this sequence difficult to synthesize?
choices:
  A: A 30 bp region with 95% GC content that is prone to synthesis errors due to strong secondary structure in the single-stranded intermediates
  B: The sequence uses too many different codons (high diversity)
  C: The sequence does not begin with ATG
  D: The protein it encodes is too large for E. coli to express
answer: A
explanation: |
  Gene synthesis involves single-stranded DNA intermediates (oligos) that
  can form strong secondary structures if they have extreme GC content.
  Regions of very high or very low GC content are notorious synthesis
  failure points. This is a fabrication constraint that the checker
  might miss if it only examines the double-stranded design. Option B —
  high codon diversity is actually desirable. Option C would be a design
  error caught by the algorithm. Option D is about expression, not
  synthesis.
