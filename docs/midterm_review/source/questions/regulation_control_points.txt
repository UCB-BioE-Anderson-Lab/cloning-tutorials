slug: promoter-elements-transcription-rate
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying which molecular features of a promoter determine transcription initiation rate
question: |
  You are comparing two promoters that drive expression of the same gene in E. coli.
  Promoter A has a -10 box of <pre>TATAAT</pre> and a -35 box of <pre>TTGACA</pre>.
  Promoter B has a -10 box of <pre>CATAAT</pre> and a -35 box of <pre>TTGACA</pre>.
  Both use sigma-70. Promoter A produces 10x more transcript than Promoter B.

  Which explanation best accounts for the difference?
choices:
  A: The single base change in the -10 box reduces sigma factor affinity, lowering RNAP recruitment
  B: The -10 box change alters the mRNA sequence, destabilizing the ribosome binding site
  C: Sigma factor only recognizes the -35 box, so the -10 change has no effect
  D: The -10 mutation changes the protein sequence of the downstream gene
answer: A
explanation: |
  Sigma factor recognizes both the -10 and -35 promoter elements. <pre>TATAAT</pre>
  is the sigma-70 consensus -10 sequence, so changing it to <pre>CATAAT</pre>
  weakens promoter recognition and reduces formation of a productive open complex.
  That lowers transcription initiation rate. This is a transcriptional control point.

  Option B confuses promoter DNA with the transcribed mRNA region that contains the
  RBS. Option C is incorrect because sigma factor contacts both boxes. Option D is
  incorrect because promoter sequence is upstream of the coding region and is not
  translated.

slug: rbs-sequence-translation-initiation
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how Shine-Dalgarno sequence complementarity affects translation rate
question: |
  Two constructs encode the same protein but differ only in their ribosome binding
  site (RBS) region. Construct 1 has the Shine-Dalgarno sequence <pre>AGGAGG</pre>
  at position -8 relative to the start codon. Construct 2 has <pre>ACCACC</pre>
  at the same position. Both produce identical mRNA levels.

  What is the most likely effect on protein expression?
choices:
  A: Construct 2 produces more protein because ACCACC avoids stalling
  B: Both produce equal protein because the mRNA levels are the same
  C: Construct 1 produces more protein because AGGAGG base-pairs more strongly with 16S rRNA
  D: Construct 2 produces more protein because its SD sequence recruits additional ribosomes
answer: C
explanation: |
  The Shine-Dalgarno sequence promotes translation initiation by base-pairing with the
  anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence at the 3' end of 16S rRNA. <pre>AGGAGG</pre> is a
  strong consensus-like SD sequence and provides stronger complementarity than
  <pre>ACCACC</pre>, which reduces ribosome recruitment and initiation.

  Equal mRNA levels do not imply equal protein output, because translation initiation
  is an independent control point. Option A and D do not provide a valid mechanism.
  Option B incorrectly treats transcription and translation as the same process.

slug: secondary-structure-blocks-translation
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how mRNA secondary structure near the start codon can occlude the RBS
question: |
  You design a construct with a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence and optimal spacing
  to the start codon. However, an RNA folding prediction shows that the SD sequence
  is sequestered in a stable hairpin formed between the SD region and nucleotides
  downstream of the start codon. Protein expression is very low despite high mRNA
  levels.

  What is the most likely cause?
choices:
  A: The hairpin is acting as a Rho-independent terminator, ending transcription early
  B: The hairpin occludes the SD sequence, preventing 30S ribosomal subunit binding
  C: The hairpin changes the codon usage of the downstream CDS
  D: The hairpin causes RNase E to degrade the mRNA before translation can begin
answer: B
explanation: |
  Translation initiation requires the 30S ribosomal subunit to access the
  Shine-Dalgarno sequence and base-pair with 16S rRNA. If the SD sequence is trapped
  in a stable hairpin, the ribosome cannot bind efficiently, so translation initiation
  is strongly reduced even if the SD sequence itself is strong.

  This is why secondary structure near the start region (often approximated as the
  window around the start codon) is a major determinant of expression. Option A
  describes a terminator mechanism, which requires the right sequence context and
  location. Option C confuses sequence with structure. Option D is possible in some
  cases, but it does not best explain low protein together with high mRNA.

slug: steady-state-mrna-levels
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how synthesis and degradation rates jointly determine steady-state mRNA concentration
question: |
  Two genes are transcribed at the same rate from identical promoters. Gene A's mRNA
  has a half-life of 2 minutes, while Gene B's mRNA has a half-life of 20 minutes.
  Both are measured at steady state.

  What is the expected relationship between their mRNA levels?
choices:
  A: Gene A has ~10x more mRNA because faster turnover means faster production
  B: Gene B has ~10x more mRNA because it persists longer before being degraded
  C: Both have equal mRNA levels because they have the same transcription rate
  D: Gene A has more mRNA because short-lived mRNAs are preferentially stabilized by ribosomes
answer: B
explanation: |
  At steady state, mRNA abundance depends on both synthesis and degradation. If
  transcription rates are equal, the mRNA with the longer half-life accumulates to a
  higher steady-state level because it is removed more slowly.

  Since Gene B's mRNA half-life is 10x longer (20 min vs 2 min), Gene B is expected
  to have roughly 10x more mRNA at steady state. Option A reverses the relationship.
  Option C ignores degradation. Option D is not a general rule and does not explain
  the stated comparison.

slug: codon-usage-expression-variation
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how synonymous codon choice affects protein expression independently of regulation
question: |
  Two constructs encode the exact same GFP protein with identical promoters, RBS
  sequences, and terminators. The only difference is that Construct 1 uses codons
  abundant in E. coli, while Construct 2 uses rare codons throughout the CDS.
  Construct 1 produces 100x more fluorescence.

  Which statement best explains this result?
choices:
  A: Rare codons change the amino acid sequence, producing a nonfunctional protein
  B: Rare codons slow ribosome elongation, reducing the rate of completed protein and potentially destabilizing the mRNA
  C: Rare codons prevent transcription by blocking RNA polymerase
  D: Rare codons change the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, blocking translation initiation
answer: B
explanation: |
  Synonymous codons encode the same amino acid sequence, so the protein identity is
  unchanged. However, codon choice can strongly affect expression by changing
  translation elongation kinetics. Rare codons are decoded by lower-abundance tRNAs,
  which can slow ribosomes and reduce the rate of completed protein production. In
  some contexts, this can also contribute to reduced mRNA stability.

  Option A is incorrect because synonymous codons do not change the amino acid
  sequence. Option C is incorrect because RNA polymerase does not read codons during
  transcription. Option D is incorrect because the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is in the
  5' UTR, not in the coding sequence.

slug: rbs-swap-what-changes
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing which molecular properties change vs. remain constant when an RBS part is swapped
question: |
  You are tuning expression of an enzyme in a metabolic pathway. You swap the RBS in
  your construct from a strong RBS (high translation initiation rate) to a weak RBS
  (low translation initiation rate). The CDS, promoter, and terminator remain
  unchanged.

  Which of the following changes as a result of this swap?
choices:
  A: The amino acid sequence of the enzyme
  B: The metabolite concentrations in the pathway
  C: The post-translational modifications of the enzyme
  D: The enzymatic activity per molecule of protein
answer: B
explanation: |
  Swapping the RBS changes translation initiation rate, which changes how much enzyme
  is produced. Changing enzyme abundance can change pathway flux and therefore alter
  metabolite concentrations.

  The RBS is in the 5' UTR, so it does not change the coding sequence and therefore
  does not change the amino acid sequence (A). It also does not change the intrinsic
  catalytic activity per molecule (D). Option C is not the expected consequence of an
  RBS swap in this context.

slug: transcriptional-vs-translational-control
difficulty: medium
topic: Classifying genetic parts by whether they act at the transcriptional or translational level
question: |
  A student is debugging a construct that produces no detectable protein. They
  measure mRNA and find abundant transcript. They then inspect the 5' UTR and find
  that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence has been deleted.

  At which level of gene expression is the problem?
choices:
  A: Transcriptional — the promoter is not recruiting RNA polymerase
  B: Translational — without an SD sequence, ribosomes cannot initiate translation on the mRNA
  C: Post-translational — the protein is being degraded immediately after synthesis
  D: Transcriptional — without the SD, RNA polymerase cannot terminate properly
answer: B
explanation: |
  Abundant mRNA indicates that transcription is occurring, so the promoter is working.
  The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is needed for efficient ribosome recruitment to the mRNA.
  If the SD sequence is deleted, translation initiation fails and little or no protein
  is produced despite abundant transcript.

  Option A is contradicted by the mRNA measurement. Option C would require protein to
  be synthesized first. Option D confuses translation initiation signals with
  transcription termination.

slug: same-protein-different-cds-expression
difficulty: medium
topic: Explaining why identical proteins can have different expression levels from different DNA encodings
question: |
  A lab orders two synthetic genes encoding the identical lysozyme protein. Gene
  version 1 is codon-optimized for E. coli. Gene version 2 uses the original
  bacteriophage codon usage. Both are cloned into the same vector with the same
  promoter, RBS, and terminator. Version 1 produces 50x more lysozyme.

  What is the BEST explanation for why two DNA sequences encoding the same protein
  yield such different expression levels?
choices:
  A: The different DNA sequences produce different amino acid sequences
  B: The different codons result in different mRNA sequences, affecting secondary structure near the start codon and ribosome elongation rate
  C: Codon-optimized genes have stronger promoters
  D: The bacteriophage version has a weaker Shine-Dalgarno sequence
answer: B
explanation: |
  Synonymous codon changes alter the mRNA sequence without changing the amino acid
  sequence. That can change local mRNA secondary structure near the start codon (which
  affects translation initiation) and can also change elongation rate because codons
  differ in tRNA availability.

  These effects can produce large expression differences even when promoter, RBS, and
  terminator are unchanged. Option A is incorrect because the proteins are stated to
  be identical. Option C is incorrect because both constructs use the same promoter.
  Option D is incorrect because the RBS is in the 5' UTR and is the same in both
  constructs.

slug: terminator-transcript-boundary
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how terminators define the 3' boundary of a transcript and prevent read-through
question: |
  An operon contains Gene A followed by Gene B, each with its own RBS and start
  codon. A strong Rho-independent terminator is placed between Gene A and Gene B.
  When the terminator is present, Gene B protein levels are very low. When the
  terminator is removed, Gene B is expressed at high levels from the same promoter
  driving Gene A.

  What role is the terminator playing?
choices:
  A: The terminator is degrading Gene B's protein after it is translated
  B: The terminator hairpin is blocking the ribosome from reaching Gene B's start codon
  C: The terminator causes RNA polymerase to dissociate before it can transcribe Gene B, so Gene B has no mRNA
  D: The terminator changes the reading frame of Gene B
answer: C
explanation: |
  A Rho-independent terminator forms a stable RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract,
  which promotes dissociation of RNA polymerase from the DNA template. When the
  terminator is placed between Gene A and Gene B, it stops transcription before Gene B
  is transcribed, so Gene B lacks mRNA and is not expressed.

  Removing the terminator allows transcriptional read-through into Gene B, producing a
  polycistronic transcript from which Gene B can be translated using its own RBS.
  Option A confuses transcription with protein degradation. Option B confuses
  termination with RBS occlusion. Option D has no mechanistic basis.

slug: rna-stability-expression-level
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how RNA degradation rate contributes to steady-state protein expression
question: |
  You are engineering a biosensor whose output protein should drop quickly after an
  inducer signal disappears. You want the protein level to decay rapidly once
  transcription stops.

  Which design strategy would MOST help achieve fast signal decay?
choices:
  A: Use a very stable mRNA with no RNase E cleavage sites so that translation continues efficiently
  B: Engineer the mRNA to contain RNase E cleavage sites and use a protein degradation tag, so both mRNA and protein turn over rapidly
  C: Use the strongest possible RBS to maximize translation before the mRNA is degraded
  D: Remove the terminator so that read-through transcription produces more mRNA
answer: B
explanation: |
  Fast signal decay requires rapid clearance of both the mRNA and the protein after
  transcription stops. If the mRNA remains stable, translation can continue after the
  inducer is gone, which slows the response. Adding RNase E-sensitive features can
  shorten mRNA lifetime, and adding a protein degradation tag increases protein
  turnover.

  Option C can increase expression output but does not improve decay kinetics. Option D
  increases transcript production, which opposes the design goal. Temporal control of
  expression depends on both synthesis and degradation processes.
