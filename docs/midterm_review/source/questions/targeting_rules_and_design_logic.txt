question: |
  What is the reverse complement of the DNA sequence:

  <pre>ATCGAGA</pre>
choices:
  A: <pre>3'-ATCGAGA-5'</pre>
  B: <pre>5'-TCTCGAT-3'</pre>
  C: <pre>ATCGAGA</pre>
  D: <pre>TAGCTCT</pre>
answer: B
explanation: |
  The reverse complement is found in two steps. First, take the complement of
  each base (A↔T, C↔G), so <pre>ATCGAGA</pre> becomes <pre>TAGCTCT</pre>.
  Then reverse that string so the opposite strand is written in the standard
  5'→3' orientation, giving <pre>TCTCGAT</pre>.

  Option D is the complement only (not reversed). Option A is the original
  sequence with flipped end labels, not the reverse complement. Option C is the
  unchanged input.

topic: Understanding how a recognition rule limits where a tool can act on a sequence
question: |
  A Cas9 CRISPR system requires an NGG PAM adjacent to the target site.
  A researcher wants to knock out a gene but finds no NGG motif within the
  first 200 bp of the coding sequence on either strand.

  What is the most accurate conclusion?
choices:
  A: Cas9 cannot target this region; a different CRISPR system or a target further downstream must be used
  B: The researcher should add an NGG sequence to the gene before targeting it
  C: Cas9 can still target the region if the guide RNA is made longer than 20 nt
  D: The PAM requirement only applies to the forward strand, so checking one strand is sufficient
answer: A
explanation: |
  The PAM is a fixed requirement of the Cas9 protein and must be present in the
  genomic DNA adjacent to the target. Without an NGG on either strand, Cas9 has
  no valid binding site in that region.

  Option B is not a practical solution to the targeting problem as stated.
  Option C is wrong because guide length does not override the PAM requirement.
  Option D is wrong because DNA is double-stranded and a valid PAM can be on
  either strand.

difficulty: medium
topic: Translating a biological positional rule into correct sequence indices
question: |
  A function searches a target DNA string for the Cas9 PAM and extracts
  the 20 bp protospacer. Given:

  <python>
  target = 'ATGCCCTAGATGCCTGGCTCAGAAACCTGCC'
  pam_index = target.find('GG', 21)   # returns 24
  </python>

  Which slice correctly extracts the protospacer?
choices:
  A: target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1]
  B: target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index]
  C: target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index - 1]
  D: target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index]
answer: A
explanation: |
  For Cas9, the PAM is NGG and the N is not part of the protospacer. If
  <python>pam_index</python> points to the first G of GG, then the N is at
  <python>pam_index - 1</python>. The 20 bp protospacer ends immediately before
  that N.

  Therefore the protospacer spans indices <python>pam_index - 21</python>
  through <python>pam_index - 2</python> inclusive, which in Python slicing is
  <python>target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1]</python>.

  Option B includes the PAM-adjacent N. Option C is only 19 bp. Option D is 21
  bp and also includes the N.

difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how an indexing error propagates into a biological design failure
question: |
  A student's gRNA design function extracts the protospacer as:

  <python>
  protospacer = target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index]
  </python>

  instead of the correct <python>target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1]</python>.
  The resulting guide RNA is synthesized and tested. What is the most likely
  outcome?
choices:
  A: The guide targets a shifted position that overlaps the PAM by one base, likely reducing or eliminating editing
  B: The guide will work identically because one base difference is tolerated
  C: The function will raise an IndexError at runtime
  D: The guide RNA will be 19 bp instead of 20 bp
answer: A
explanation: |
  The incorrect slice still returns 20 bases, but it includes the N of the NGG
  PAM and omits the first base of the true protospacer. That shifts the guide by
  one base toward the PAM.

  Cas9 targeting depends on the correct protospacer sequence adjacent to (not
  overlapping) the PAM, so this shift will often severely reduce or eliminate
  editing. Option C is wrong because the slice is syntactically valid. Option D
  is wrong because the slice length is still 20.

slug: both-strands-must-be-checked
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing when a search must consider complementary representations of the same data
question: |
  A function searches for Cas9 PAM sites on a target gene:

  <python>
  def find_pam(target):
      return target.find('GG', 21)
  </python>

  It returns -1 for a known targetable gene. A colleague points out the
  error. What did the function fail to do?
choices:
  A: Search the reverse complement of the target for GG on the opposite strand
  B: Search for 'CC' instead, since that is the complement of GG
  C: Use a regular expression instead of .find()
  D: Search from position 0 instead of position 21
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA is double-stranded, so a valid PAM can occur on either strand. If the
  forward strand search finds no valid GG in the required position range, a PAM
  may still exist on the opposite strand and will be found by searching the
  reverse complement.

  Option B is not equivalent, because simply searching for <python>'CC'</python>
  on the forward strand does not preserve the correct spatial relationship
  between PAM and protospacer. Option C does not fix the strand-coverage error.
  Option D changes the search window but not the missing-strand logic.

topic: Tracing a data transformation through multiple encoding steps
question: |
  Given a DNA target with protospacer <pre>CATCGCCGCAGCGGTTTCAG</pre> adjacent to
  an NGG PAM, a function must produce the guide RNA. The gRNA scaffold is a
  constant string appended after the targeting sequence. Which step correctly
  converts the protospacer to the targeting portion of the gRNA?
choices:
  A: Replace every T in the protospacer with U to produce the RNA version of the same sequence
  B: Take the reverse complement of the protospacer and then replace T with U
  C: Translate the protospacer into amino acids using the genetic code
  D: Reverse the protospacer string without complementing, then replace T with U
answer: A
explanation: |
  In this convention, the protospacer is the DNA sequence corresponding to the
  guide-targeting region. To generate the gRNA targeting sequence, convert that
  DNA sequence to RNA by replacing T with U.

  Option B incorrectly reverse-complements the protospacer. Option C confuses
  guide design with protein translation. Option D reverses the sequence without
  biological justification.

slug: cas12a-vs-cas9-rules
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing how changing a system's rules changes the algorithm that implements it
question: |
  Cas9 uses an NGG PAM on the 3' side of the protospacer, while Cas12a
  uses a TTTV PAM on the 5' side. A student has a working Cas9 gRNA
  design function. Which change is necessary to adapt it for Cas12a?
choices:
  A: Search for TTTV instead of NGG, and extract the protospacer downstream (3') of the PAM instead of upstream
  B: Simply replace the string 'GG' with 'TTTV' in the search; the protospacer extraction stays the same
  C: Keep the same PAM search but reverse complement the entire target before running the function
  D: Use the same function but extend the protospacer from 20 bp to 24 bp
answer: A
explanation: |
  The key change is not just the PAM motif but the PAM position relative to the
  protospacer. Cas12a uses a PAM on the 5' side of the target sequence, so the
  extraction direction changes compared with Cas9.

  Option B changes only the motif and leaves the geometry wrong. Option C does
  not solve the changed PAM-side rule. Option D changes length without fixing
  extraction logic.

difficulty: medium
topic: Deciding what a function should do when a required precondition is not met
question: |
  A gRNA design function searches for a PAM in the target sequence but
  finds none. Which is the best way to handle this case?
choices:
  A: Raise a ValueError with a message explaining that no valid PAM was found
  B: Return None silently so the caller can check for it
  C: Return a gRNA using positions 0–19 as a default protospacer
  D: Print a warning message and return an empty string
answer: A
explanation: |
  If no PAM is present, the biological precondition for design is not met and
  the function cannot produce a valid guide. Raising a <python>ValueError</python>
  with a clear message makes the failure explicit and prevents downstream code
  from using an invalid design.

  Option B can be made to work in some coding styles, but silent return values
  are easy to misuse. Option C returns an invalid design. Option D mixes error
  reporting with ambiguous return values.

slug: parameterizing-pam-rule
difficulty: medium
topic: Designing a function interface that accommodates varying biological rules
question: |
  A lab uses both Cas9 (PAM = NGG) and Cas12a (PAM = TTTV) in different
  experiments. A developer wants a single gRNA design function that works
  for both systems. What is the best approach?
choices:
  A: Accept the PAM pattern, protospacer length, and PAM-side (5' or 3') as parameters
  B: Hard-code both PAM rules with an if/else and a system_name string parameter
  C: Write two completely separate functions with no shared code
  D: Always search for both PAMs and return whichever match is found first
answer: A
explanation: |
  Parameterizing the PAM pattern, protospacer length, and PAM-side makes the
  function extensible to multiple CRISPR systems without rewriting the core
  logic.

  Option B can work for a small number of systems but scales poorly. Option C
  duplicates logic. Option D ignores the fact that different systems use
  different guide designs and must be selected intentionally.

slug: strand-orientation-and-protospacer
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how strand orientation determines which 20 bp sequence is the protospacer
question: |
  A target gene's forward strand (5'→3') contains:

  <pre>
  ...ACGTTGACCGATCCTGAAGG TCA...
                       ^^^
                       NGG (PAM)
  </pre>

  The PAM on the forward strand is <pre>AGG</pre>. A colleague says the
  protospacer must always be taken from the reverse strand.

  Which statement is correct?
choices:
  A: The protospacer is the 20 bp immediately upstream (5') of the PAM on the same strand where the PAM is found, so in this case it is read from the forward strand
  B: The protospacer always comes from the reverse strand regardless of which strand contains the PAM
  C: Either strand gives the same protospacer because DNA is double-stranded
  D: The protospacer should be chosen from whichever strand has higher GC content
answer: A
explanation: |
  For Cas9, the protospacer is defined relative to the PAM location: it is the
  20 bp sequence immediately upstream (5') of the NGG PAM on the same strand in
  which the PAM is identified. If the PAM is on the forward strand, the
  protospacer is read from the forward strand. If the PAM is on the reverse
  strand, the protospacer is read from the reverse strand.

  Option B is wrong because strand choice depends on PAM location. Option C is
  wrong because the two strands are complementary, not identical. Option D is
  unrelated to the targeting rule.
