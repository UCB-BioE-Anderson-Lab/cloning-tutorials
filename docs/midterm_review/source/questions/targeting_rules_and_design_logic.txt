question: |
  What is the reverse complement of the DNA sequence:

  <pre>ATCGAGA</pre>
choices:
  A: <pre>3'-ATCGAGA-5'</pre>
  B: <pre>5'-TCTCGAT-3'</pre>
  C: <pre>ATCGAGA</pre>
  D: <pre>TAGCTCT</pre>
answer: B
explanation: |
  The reverse complement is found in two steps: first take the complement
  of each base (A↔T, C↔G), so ATCGAGA becomes TAGCTCT. Then reverse that
  string to keep the opposite strand in the standard 5'→3' orientation,
  giving TCTCGAT.

  Option D is the complement only (not reversed). Option A is just the
  original sequence shown with reversed end labels, not the reverse
  complement. Option C is the unchanged input.

  Therefore the correct answer is 5'-TCTCGAT-3'.

question: |
  A Cas9 CRISPR system requires an NGG PAM adjacent to the target site.
  A researcher wants to knock out a gene but finds no NGG motif within the
  first 200 bp of the coding sequence on either strand.

  What is the most accurate conclusion?
choices:
  A: Cas9 cannot target this region; a different CRISPR system or a target further downstream must be used
  B: The researcher should add an NGG sequence to the gene before targeting it
  C: Cas9 can still target the region if the guide RNA is made longer than 20 nt
  D: The PAM requirement only applies to the forward strand, so checking one strand is sufficient
answer: A
explanation: |
  The PAM is a fixed requirement of the Cas9 protein — it must be present
  in the genomic DNA adjacent to the target. Without an NGG on either strand,
  Cas9 has no valid binding site in that region. Option B is nonsensical
  because adding a PAM would require already editing the gene. Option C is
  wrong because guide length does not override the PAM requirement. Option D
  is wrong because DNA is double-stranded and the PAM can appear on either
  strand.

topic: Translating a biological positional rule into correct sequence indices
question: |
  A function searches a target DNA string for the Cas9 PAM and extracts
  the 20 bp protospacer. Given:

  <python>
  target = 'ATGCCCTAGATGCCTGGCTCAGAAACCTGCC'
  pam_index = target.find('GG', 21)   # returns 24
  </python>

  Which slice correctly extracts the protospacer?
choices:
  A: target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1]
  B: target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index]
  C: target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index - 1]
  D: target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index]
answer: A
explanation: |
  The PAM is NGG, where the N is not part of the protospacer. The two G's
  found at pam_index are the GG of NGG, so the N sits at pam_index - 1.
  The 20 bp protospacer ends just before the N, spanning indices
  pam_index - 21 through pam_index - 2 inclusive, which in Python slice
  notation is target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1]. Option B includes
  the N in the protospacer. Option C is only 19 bp. Option D is 21 bp
  and includes the N.

topic: Reasoning about how an indexing error propagates into a biological design failure
question: |
  A student's gRNA design function extracts the protospacer as:

  <python>
  protospacer = target[pam_index - 20 : pam_index]
  </python>

  instead of the correct target[pam_index - 21 : pam_index - 1].
  The resulting guide RNA is synthesized and tested. What is the most
  likely outcome?
choices:
  A: The guide targets a shifted position that overlaps the PAM by one base, likely reducing or eliminating editing
  B: The guide will work identically because one base difference is tolerated
  C: The function will raise an IndexError at runtime
  D: The guide RNA will be 19 bp instead of 20 bp
answer: A
explanation: |
  The incorrect slice includes the N of the NGG PAM and excludes the first
  base of the true protospacer. The resulting 20-mer is shifted by one
  position toward the PAM. Because the guide must pair with the target
  adjacent to (not overlapping) the PAM, this mismatch at the PAM-proximal
  end — the seed region critical for binding — will likely abolish or
  severely reduce editing. The slice still produces a 20 bp string
  (not 19), and it will not cause an IndexError.

difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing when a search must consider complementary representations of the same data
question: |
  A function searches for Cas9 PAM sites on a target gene:

  <python>
  def find_pam(target):
      return target.find('GG', 21)
  </python>

  It returns -1 for a known targetable gene. A colleague points out the
  error. What did the function fail to do?
choices:
  A: Search the reverse complement of the target for GG on the opposite strand
  B: Search for 'CC' instead, since that is the complement of GG
  C: Use a regular expression instead of .find()
  D: Search from position 0 instead of position 21
answer: A
explanation: |
  DNA is double-stranded. A PAM site can be on either strand. If the
  forward strand has no GG in a valid position, the reverse complement
  strand might. The function must generate the reverse complement and
  search it as well. Option B is wrong because searching for CC on the
  forward strand is not equivalent to finding GG on the reverse strand —
  the spatial relationship to the protospacer differs. Option C would not
  fix the missing-strand problem. Option D would find GG's too close to
  the start for a valid 20 bp protospacer.

difficulty: medium
topic: Tracing a data transformation through multiple encoding steps
question: |
  Given a DNA target with protospacer <pre>CATCGCCGCAGCGGTTTCAG</pre> adjacent to
  an NGG PAM, a function must produce the guide RNA. The gRNA scaffold is
  a constant string appended after the targeting sequence. Which step
  correctly converts the protospacer to the targeting portion of the gRNA?
choices:
  A: Replace every T in the protospacer with U to produce the RNA version of the same sequence
  B: Take the reverse complement of the protospacer and then replace T with U
  C: Translate the protospacer into amino acids using the genetic code
  D: Reverse the protospacer string without complementing, then replace T with U
answer: A
explanation: |
  The guide RNA base-pairs with the target strand, so its sequence is
  complementary to the target strand — which is the same as the non-target
  (protospacer) strand. Therefore the gRNA targeting sequence is simply
  the protospacer sequence rewritten as RNA (T→U). Option B would produce
  a sequence complementary to the protospacer, which is the target strand
  itself — the guide would pair with itself conceptually. Option C confuses
  transcription with translation. Option D reverses without complementing,
  which produces a meaningless sequence.

slug: cas12a-vs-cas9-rules
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing how changing a system's rules changes the algorithm that implements it
question: |
  Cas9 uses an NGG PAM on the 3' side of the protospacer, while Cas12a
  uses a TTTV PAM on the 5' side. A student has a working Cas9 gRNA
  design function. Which change is necessary to adapt it for Cas12a?
choices:
  A: Search for TTTV instead of NGG, and extract the protospacer downstream (3') of the PAM instead of upstream
  B: Simply replace the string 'GG' with 'TTTV' in the search; the protospacer extraction stays the same
  C: Keep the same PAM search but reverse complement the entire target before running the function
  D: Use the same function but extend the protospacer from 20 bp to 24 bp
answer: A
explanation: |
  Cas12a has a fundamentally different PAM position relative to the
  protospacer. The PAM sits on the 5' side, so the protospacer is
  extracted from positions downstream (3') of the PAM — the opposite
  direction from Cas9. Option B changes only the search pattern but not
  the extraction direction, which would grab the wrong region. Option C
  does not address the different spatial relationship. Option D changes
  protospacer length but not the extraction logic.

slug: no-valid-pam-error-handling
difficulty: medium
topic: Deciding what a function should do when a required precondition is not met
question: |
  A gRNA design function searches for a PAM in the target sequence but
  finds none. Which is the best way to handle this case?
choices:
  A: Raise a ValueError with a message explaining that no valid PAM was found
  B: Return None silently so the caller can check for it
  C: Return a gRNA using positions 0–19 as a default protospacer
  D: Print a warning message and return an empty string
answer: A
explanation: |
  When a required biological precondition (the PAM must exist) is not met,
  the function cannot produce a valid result. Raising a ValueError with a
  clear message immediately signals the problem and prevents downstream
  code from using an invalid design. Option B forces every caller to check
  for None, and forgetting this check leads to subtle bugs. Option C
  returns an incorrect design that would fail experimentally. Option D
  mixes output channels and returns a value that could be mistaken for
  a valid (but empty) result.

slug: reverse-complement-for-strand-check
difficulty: medium
topic: Applying a sequence transformation to make hidden information visible
question: |
  To check for PAM sites on the opposite strand of a target, a function
  builds the reverse complement. Given:

  <pre>target = 'ATGCCAGTGC'</pre>

  What is the reverse complement?
choices:
  A: <pre>GCACTGGCAT</pre>
  B: <pre>TACGGTCACG</pre>
  C: <pre>CGTGACCGTA</pre>
  D: GCACTGGCAT reversed is TACGGTCACG
answer: A
explanation: |
  The reverse complement is computed in two steps: (1) complement each base
  (A↔T, C↔G), giving TACGGTCACG, then (2) reverse the string, giving
  GCACTGGCAT. Option B is only the complement without reversing. Option C
  is only the reverse without complementing. Option D describes two
  different strings and is not a valid answer. The reverse complement
  preserves 5'→3' reading convention for the opposite strand.

topic: Designing a function interface that accommodates varying biological rules
question: |
  A lab uses both Cas9 (PAM = NGG) and Cas12a (PAM = TTTV) in different
  experiments. A developer wants a single gRNA design function that works
  for both systems. What is the best approach?
choices:
  A: Accept the PAM pattern, protospacer length, and PAM-side (5' or 3') as parameters
  B: Hard-code both PAM rules with an if/else and a system_name string parameter
  C: Write two completely separate functions with no shared code
  D: Always search for both PAMs and return whichever match is found first
answer: A
explanation: |
  Parameterizing the PAM pattern, protospacer length, and orientation
  makes the function extensible to any CRISPR system without code changes.
  Option B works for two systems but requires modifying the function body
  for every new system. Option C duplicates code. Option D conflates two
  different design tasks — the user must specify which system is being used,
  since the two systems produce incompatible guides.

slug: strand-orientation-and-protospacer
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how two complementary representations of the same data relate to each other
question: |
  A target gene's forward strand (5'→3') reads:

  <pre>
  ...ACGTTGACCGATCCTGAAGG TCA...
                          ^^
                       GG = PAM
  </pre>

  The GG at positions shown is the Cas9 PAM. The 20 bp protospacer on
  this strand would read 5'-ACGTTGACCGATCCTGAAGG-3' minus the last two
  bases (the GG). But a colleague says the protospacer should come from
  the reverse strand. Who is correct?
choices:
  A: The protospacer is read from the strand that contains the NGG PAM, upstream of the PAM — the forward strand in this case
  B: The protospacer always comes from the reverse strand regardless of which strand has the PAM
  C: Both strands give the same protospacer because DNA is double-stranded
  D: The protospacer comes from whichever strand has a higher GC content
answer: A
explanation: |
  The protospacer is defined as the 20 bp immediately upstream (5') of the
  NGG PAM, on the same strand where the PAM is found. The guide RNA will
  match this protospacer sequence (as RNA). If the PAM were found on the
  reverse strand instead, the protospacer would be read from the reverse
  strand. Option B is incorrect because strand choice depends on PAM
  location. Option C is wrong — the two strands give complementary, not
  identical, sequences. Option D is nonsensical.
