slug: strain-vs-genotype-distinction
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing between a strain name, the living cell population it refers to, and the genotype that describes it
question: |
  A lab maintains a freezer stock labeled "Mach1." A new student asks whether
  "Mach1" refers to the specific mutations (recA1398, endA1, etc.) or to the
  population of cells in the tube.

  Which answer is most precise?
choices:
  A: Mach1 is the genotype because it lists every mutation present in the cells
  B: Mach1 is a strain, a genetically homogeneous population derived from a single cell; the genotype is the list of mutations that distinguish it from its parent
  C: Mach1 is a phenotype because it describes what the cells can do, not what DNA they carry
  D: Mach1 is a composition because it specifies what proteins should be present
answer: B
explanation: |
  A strain is a population-level concept: a genetically uniform group of cells
  traced to a single colony (or clone). The genotype is the set of genetic
  differences, usually described relative to a parent strain, that characterizes
  that strain.

  Option A conflates the strain name with the genotype description. Option C
  confuses genotype with phenotype. Option D confuses a living biological strain
  with an abstract design specification.

slug: composition-specifies-vs-leaves-open
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying what an abstract biological specification commits to and what it leaves unresolved
question: |
  A Composition for a biosynthetic pathway specifies:
  - Host: E. coli
  - Proteins: LuxA, LuxB, LuxC, LuxD, LuxE

  A student assumes this Composition also determines the promoter driving each
  gene and whether the genes are on a plasmid or integrated into the chromosome.
  Is the student correct?
choices:
  A: Yes, because a Composition must specify all implementation details to be useful
  B: No, because a Composition specifies the chassis and target proteins but deliberately leaves expression level, regulatory elements, codon usage, and genomic vs plasmid implementation unspecified
  C: No, because a Composition specifies only the DNA sequence, not the proteins
  D: Yes, because the host choice automatically determines promoters and gene location
answer: B
explanation: |
  A Composition is an abstract specification. It commits to what should be
  present (for example, host and protein identities) but intentionally leaves
  open many implementation decisions such as promoters, RBSs, copy number,
  codon usage, and whether the build is plasmid-borne or chromosomally
  integrated.

  This separation is useful because the same Composition can be implemented in
  multiple ways. Option A confuses an abstract specification with a complete
  build plan. Option C reverses the abstraction level. Option D incorrectly
  assumes host choice determines all downstream design choices.

slug: genotype-as-delta-from-parent
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why genotype descriptions emphasize changes relative to a parent strain
question: |
  The genotype of Mach1 is written as:

  <pre>str. W deltarecA1398 endA1 fhuA phi80delta(lac)M15 delta(lac)X74 hsdR(rK- mK+)</pre>

  A student argues it would be simpler to store the complete genome sequence
  instead of these cryptic delta annotations. What is the main reason genotypes
  are often expressed as changes from a parent strain?
choices:
  A: Delta notation is mainly used to reduce file size so the genotype fits in a database field
  B: Relative notation highlights the mutations that matter for strain behavior, while a full genome sequence hides those differences among millions of unchanged bases
  C: The complete genome of E. coli is unknown, so delta notation is the only option
  D: Delta notation is legally required for genetically modified organisms
answer: B
explanation: |
  Relative genotype notation is useful because it emphasizes the changes that
  distinguish the strain from its parent and often explain its engineering
  properties. A complete genome sequence contains far more information than is
  usually needed for routine strain identity and engineering context, and the
  few relevant differences are hard to spot without a comparison.

  Option A treats the notation as a storage trick rather than an information and
  interpretation tool. Option C is false. Option D is fabricated.

slug: antibiotic-selection-compatibility
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about why antibiotic selection depends on compatibility between host background and vector marker
question: |
  A researcher wants to transform a plasmid carrying a kanamycin resistance gene
  (KanR) into a strain that already has a chromosomal KanR insertion from a
  previous engineering step. They plan to select transformants on kanamycin
  plates.

  What is wrong with this plan?
choices:
  A: Nothing, because extra copies of KanR will make transformants grow much faster than non-transformants
  B: The host already survives on kanamycin, so both transformants and non-transformants form colonies and the selection cannot distinguish them
  C: Two copies of KanR are generally lethal because resistance genes are highly toxic when overexpressed
  D: Kanamycin resistance works only from plasmids, not from chromosomal insertions
answer: B
explanation: |
  Antibiotic selection works only if cells lacking the plasmid are sensitive to
  the antibiotic. If the host strain already carries a functional chromosomal
  KanR gene, untransformed cells also survive on kanamycin, so the plate no
  longer selects for plasmid uptake.

  The practical fix is to use a different selectable marker that the host does
  not already carry. Option A misunderstands the purpose of selection. Option C
  is not generally true. Option D is factually incorrect.

slug: same-composition-different-genotypes
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how one abstract specification can be implemented by multiple distinct genotypes
question: |
  Two labs independently implement the same Composition:
  - Host: E. coli
  - Proteins: GFP, LacI

  Lab A puts both genes on a high-copy plasmid with strong promoters.
  Lab B integrates both genes into the chromosome under weak promoters with
  codon optimization for E. coli.

  Both labs produce cells that express GFP and LacI. How do their results relate
  to the Composition?
choices:
  A: Only Lab A implements the Composition correctly because plasmids are the standard method
  B: Neither lab implements the Composition because they used different engineering strategies
  C: Both satisfy the Composition, but they created different genotypes and likely different phenotypes
  D: Both have the same genotype because they started from the same Composition
answer: C
explanation: |
  A Composition specifies what is required at a high level (here, host and
  protein identities), not the detailed implementation strategy. Both labs can
  satisfy the same Composition while making different choices about promoter
  strength, copy number, codon usage, and genomic location.

  Those choices produce different DNA architectures and therefore different
  genotypes, and they often produce different phenotypes such as expression
  level, growth rate, and burden. Option A inserts a preference not stated by
  the Composition. Option B misunderstands what it means to satisfy a spec.
  Option D confuses abstract specification with concrete genotype.

slug: chassis-constrains-design
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how chassis choice constrains which regulatory elements and expression mechanisms are valid
question: |
  A researcher designs a gene expression cassette using an E. coli sigma-70
  promoter and a strong E. coli ribosome binding site. They then move the same
  cassette into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) without any modifications.

  What is most likely to happen?
choices:
  A: The gene will express normally because promoters and RBS sequences are universal across organisms
  B: The gene will express at a lower level due to codon usage differences, but the bacterial promoter and RBS will still function
  C: The gene will likely fail to express because yeast does not use bacterial sigma-70 promoters or Shine-Dalgarno-based translation initiation
  D: The gene will express but produce a nonfunctional protein because yeast ribosomes translate too fast
answer: C
explanation: |
  Chassis choice constrains what regulatory parts are valid. Yeast and bacteria
  use different transcription and translation initiation machinery. Yeast RNA
  polymerase does not recognize bacterial sigma-70 promoters, and yeast
  translation initiation does not rely on bacterial Shine-Dalgarno pairing.

  A yeast-compatible implementation would require yeast regulatory elements,
  including an appropriate promoter and translation initiation context. Option A
  assumes universality that does not exist. Option B underestimates the problem.
  Option D proposes an incorrect mechanism.

slug: what-makes-a-strain-engineerable
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying host strain features that improve routine plasmid cloning and DNA handling
question: |
  Mach1 carries several mutations including recA1398 (defective
  recombination), endA1 (defective endonuclease), and hsdR(rK- mK+)
  (does not restrict incoming DNA but still methylates DNA).

  Why are these mutations helpful for plasmid-based genetic engineering,
  rather than being random changes?
choices:
  A: They primarily increase growth rate, which is the main goal of cloning strains
  B: They reduce host activities that would otherwise rearrange, degrade, or restrict foreign DNA
  C: They are auxotrophic markers used for selection on minimal media
  D: They allow cells to survive higher temperatures during heat shock
answer: B
explanation: |
  Cloning strains are engineered to make foreign DNA easier to introduce,
  maintain, and recover. In this example, recA defects reduce homologous
  recombination that can rearrange repeated sequences, endA1 improves plasmid DNA
  quality by reducing nuclease activity, and hsdR defects reduce restriction of
  incoming DNA.

  These are deliberate engineering traits for molecular cloning workflows.
  Option A is not the main purpose. Option C confuses cloning-strain features
  with nutritional markers. Option D confuses genotype with protocol details.

slug: genotype-tokens-and-dna-changes
difficulty: medium
topic: Interpreting genotype notation tokens and connecting notation to physical DNA changes
question: |
  A genotype includes the token "delta(lac)X74." A student interprets this as
  meaning the lac region is overexpressed because "delta" sounds like it could
  mean "enhanced."

  What does the delta symbol indicate in genotype notation, and what is the
  physical consequence?
choices:
  A: Delta means duplication, so there are two copies of the lac region
  B: Delta means deletion, so the designated lac region has been physically removed from the chromosome
  C: Delta means translocation, so the lac region moved to a different chromosomal location
  D: Delta means promoter replacement, so lac is now controlled by a different promoter
answer: B
explanation: |
  In genotype notation, delta denotes a deletion. The named region has been
  removed from the chromosome, so the strain lacks that DNA segment and cannot
  produce whatever gene products depend on the deleted sequence.

  Option A invents a meaning for delta. Option C describes a translocation, not
  a deletion. Option D describes a regulatory edit that would be represented
  with different notation.

slug: context-changes-design-outcomes
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how the same cassette can produce different outcomes in different genomic contexts
question: |
  A researcher characterizes a promoter-RBS-GFP cassette on a high-copy plasmid
  (about 100 copies per cell) in E. coli strain DH10B and measures strong
  fluorescence. They then integrate the identical cassette as a single
  chromosomal copy in the same strain. Fluorescence drops by about 100-fold.

  What is the best explanation?
choices:
  A: Integration usually mutates the GFP coding sequence, so fluorescence drops because the protein is damaged
  B: Gene copy number changed from about 100 templates to one, so total mRNA and protein output per cell drops substantially
  C: Chromosomal DNA cannot be transcribed efficiently by RNA polymerase
  D: The promoter works only on circular plasmids and not in the chromosome
answer: B
explanation: |
  The cassette sequence is the same, but the genomic context changed. Copy number
  is a major contextual variable. A high-copy plasmid provides many templates for
  transcription, while a single chromosomal insertion provides only one. With far
  fewer transcription templates, total mRNA and protein output usually drops.

  This is a core example of why identical parts can produce different phenotypes
  in different contexts. Option A is not the expected explanation. Option C is
  false. Option D is false.

slug: dna-string-vs-composition-information
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying what semantic design information is missing from a raw DNA sequence string
question: |
  A collaborator sends you a 3,000 bp DNA string with no annotation. You know it
  encodes a gene, but you do not know what organism it was designed for or how it
  should be used. Compared to receiving a Composition object that specifies
  "Host: E. coli, Protein: LuxA", what information are you missing from the raw
  DNA string alone?
choices:
  A: Nothing, because the DNA string contains all necessary information if you translate it
  B: You are missing high-level intent and context such as the intended host and protein identity, and you also do not know the intended implementation context from sequence alone
  C: You are missing only the host organism, because the correct protein can always be recovered by translating all six reading frames
  D: A raw DNA string contains strictly more useful information than a Composition, so nothing important is missing
answer: B
explanation: |
  A raw DNA string contains sequence-level information, but it does not encode the
  intended design semantics in a directly interpretable way. Without annotation or
  additional context, you may not know the intended host, the intended protein
  identity, the correct coding frame and start site, or how the sequence fits into
  a larger design plan.

  A Composition explicitly provides high-level design intent such as host and
  target protein identity. Option A and C overstate what can be inferred from a
  bare sequence alone. Option D misses the distinction between low-level sequence
  detail and high-level design meaning.
