slug: strain-vs-genotype-distinction
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing between a population-level identity and the specific genetic changes that define it
question: |
  A lab maintains a freezer stock labeled "Mach1." A new student asks
  whether "Mach1" refers to the specific mutations (recA1398, endA1, etc.)
  or to the population of cells in the tube.

  Which answer is most precise?
choices:
  A: Mach1 is the genotype — it lists every mutation present in the cells
  B: Mach1 is a strain — a genetically homogeneous population derived from a single cell; the genotype is the list of mutations that distinguish it from its parent
  C: Mach1 is a phenotype — it describes what the cells can do, not what DNA they carry
  D: Mach1 is a composition — it specifies what proteins should be present
answer: B
explanation: |
  A strain is a population-level concept: a genetically uniform group of cells
  traced back to a single colony. The genotype is the specific set of genetic
  changes (expressed as deltas from a parent strain) that characterize that
  population. Option A conflates the two — the name "Mach1" identifies the
  strain, not the genotype itself. Option C confuses genotype with phenotype.
  Option D confuses strain with composition, which is an abstract design
  specification rather than a living population.

difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying what an abstract specification commits to and what it deliberately leaves unresolved
question: |
  A Composition for a biosynthetic pathway specifies:
  - Host: E. coli
  - Proteins: LuxA, LuxB, LuxC, LuxD, LuxE

  A student assumes this Composition also determines the promoter
  driving each gene and whether the genes are on a plasmid or integrated
  into the chromosome. Is the student correct?
choices:
  A: Yes — a Composition must specify all implementation details to be useful
  B: No — a Composition specifies the chassis and protein sequences but deliberately leaves expression level, regulatory elements, codon usage, and genomic vs plasmid unspecified
  C: No — a Composition specifies only the DNA sequence, not the proteins
  D: Yes — the host choice automatically determines promoters and gene location
answer: B
explanation: |
  A Composition is an abstract specification: it commits to what proteins
  should be present in which host, but intentionally does not dictate how
  those proteins are expressed. Regulatory elements, codon usage, expression
  levels, and whether genes live on a plasmid or the chromosome are all
  implementation decisions made later. This separation allows the same
  Composition to be realized in many different ways. Option A confuses an
  abstract spec with a complete build plan. Option C inverts the abstraction
  level — Composition specifies proteins, not DNA. Option D incorrectly
  assumes that choosing a host resolves all downstream decisions.

difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why genetic descriptions use relative changes from a reference rather than absolute sequences
question: |
  The genotype of Mach1 is written as:

  <pre>str. W  deltarecA1398 endA1 fhuA phi80delta(lac)M15 delta(lac)X74 hsdR(rK- mK+)</pre>

  A student argues it would be simpler to just store the complete genome
  sequence instead of these cryptic delta annotations. What is the main
  reason genotypes are expressed as deltas from a parent strain?
choices:
  A: Delta notation compresses the file size so it fits in a database field
  B: Deltas highlight what was intentionally changed, making it clear which mutations confer which properties — a full genome hides that information in millions of irrelevant bases
  C: The complete genome of E. coli is unknown, so deltas are the only option
  D: Delta notation is required by law for genetically modified organisms
answer: B
explanation: |
  The delta notation serves a cognitive and informational purpose: it tells
  you exactly which mutations distinguish this strain from its parent and
  therefore which properties were engineered or selected for. A full genome
  sequence contains millions of bases, and the handful of meaningful changes
  would be invisible without comparison. The same principle applies in
  software version control — a diff is more informative than two complete
  snapshots. Option A treats it as a storage optimization, missing the
  semantic point. Option C is factually wrong — E. coli genomes are well
  sequenced. Option D is fabricated.

slug: antibiotic-selection-compatibility
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about why a selection system requires a specific relationship between host and vector properties
question: |
  A researcher wants to transform a plasmid carrying a kanamycin resistance
  gene (KanR) into a strain that already has a chromosomal KanR insertion
  from a previous engineering step. They plan to select transformants on
  kanamycin plates.

  What is wrong with this plan?
choices:
  A: Nothing — more copies of KanR will make colonies grow faster, distinguishing transformants
  B: The strain already survives on kanamycin, so both transformants and non-transformants form colonies — the selection cannot distinguish them
  C: Two copies of KanR will be lethal to the cells due to overexpression toxicity
  D: Kanamycin resistance only works when carried on a plasmid, not on the chromosome
answer: B
explanation: |
  Antibiotic selection works by killing cells that lack the resistance gene.
  If the host strain already carries KanR chromosomally, all cells survive
  on kanamycin plates regardless of whether they took up the plasmid. The
  selection has no power to distinguish transformed from untransformed cells.
  The fix is to use a plasmid with a different resistance marker that the
  strain does not already carry. Option A misunderstands selection — growth
  rate differences are not reliable enough. Option C invents a toxicity
  that does not generally occur. Option D is factually wrong — chromosomal
  resistance genes function normally.

slug: same-composition-different-genotypes
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how an abstract specification can be realized as multiple distinct concrete implementations
question: |
  Two labs independently implement the same Composition:
  - Host: E. coli
  - Proteins: GFP, LacI

  Lab A puts both genes on a high-copy plasmid with strong promoters.
  Lab B integrates both genes into the chromosome under weak promoters
  with codon optimization for E. coli.

  Both labs have cells expressing GFP and LacI. How do their results
  relate to the Composition?
choices:
  A: Only Lab A correctly implements the Composition because plasmids are the standard method
  B: Neither lab implements the Composition because they used different strategies
  C: Both satisfy the Composition — it specifies which proteins must be present, not how they are expressed — but they have different genotypes and likely different phenotypes
  D: Both have the same genotype because they started from the same Composition
answer: C
explanation: |
  A Composition specifies what (which proteins in which host) but not how
  (regulatory elements, copy number, codon usage, genomic location). Both
  labs satisfy the abstract specification, but they made different
  implementation choices, resulting in different genotypes (different DNA
  sequences and genome architectures) and likely different phenotypes
  (different expression levels, growth rates, metabolic burden). This is
  the key distinction between abstract specification and concrete
  implementation. Option A invents a preference the Composition does not
  encode. Option B misunderstands what satisfying a spec means. Option D
  confuses Composition with genotype.

slug: chassis-constrains-design
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about how the choice of host organism constrains which design elements are valid
question: |
  A researcher designs a gene expression cassette using an E. coli sigma-70
  promoter and a strong E. coli ribosome binding site. They then attempt to
  move this cassette into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) without any
  modifications.

  What is most likely to happen?
choices:
  A: The gene will express normally — promoters and RBS sequences are universal across all organisms
  B: The gene will express at a lower level due to codon usage differences, but the promoter and RBS will function
  C: The gene will likely fail to express — yeast does not recognize bacterial sigma-70 promoters or Shine-Dalgarno-based RBS elements
  D: The gene will express but produce a non-functional protein because yeast ribosomes translate faster
answer: C
explanation: |
  Transcription and translation machinery differ fundamentally between
  bacteria and eukaryotes. Yeast RNA polymerase does not recognize bacterial
  sigma-70 promoters, and yeast ribosomes do not use Shine-Dalgarno
  sequences for translation initiation. The cassette would need a yeast-
  compatible promoter (e.g., GAL1), a Kozak-like context for translation
  initiation, and potentially intron removal if the gene were from a
  eukaryotic source. The chassis choice constrains which regulatory elements
  are valid. Option A falsely assumes universality. Option B underestimates
  the problem — it is not just codon usage. Option D invents an incorrect
  mechanism.

slug: what-makes-a-strain-engineerable
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying which genetic features of a host strain facilitate routine molecular cloning work
question: |
  Mach1 carries several mutations including recA1398 (defective
  recombination), endA1 (defective endonuclease), and hsdR(rK- mK+)
  (does not restrict foreign DNA but does methylate it).

  Why are these mutations helpful for plasmid-based genetic engineering,
  as opposed to being random changes?
choices:
  A: They increase the growth rate of the bacteria, making experiments faster
  B: They each remove a host defense system that would otherwise destroy or rearrange incoming DNA — recA prevents recombination of repeats, endA prevents nuclease degradation, and hsdR- prevents restriction of unmethylated DNA
  C: They are auxotrophic markers that allow selection on minimal media
  D: They enable the cells to survive at higher temperatures for heat-shock transformation
answer: B
explanation: |
  Each mutation in a cloning strain like Mach1 is chosen to disable a
  specific host defense that would interfere with maintaining foreign DNA.
  recA1398 prevents RecA-mediated recombination that could rearrange
  repetitive sequences on plasmids. endA1 eliminates an endonuclease that
  degrades plasmid DNA during miniprep extraction. hsdR(rK- mK+) prevents
  the restriction system from cutting incoming unmethylated DNA while still
  methylating DNA for protection. These are deliberate engineering choices,
  not random mutations. Option A is not the primary purpose. Option C
  confuses cloning mutations with nutritional markers. Option D confuses
  strain genotype with transformation protocol.

slug: genotype-tokens-and-dna-changes
difficulty: medium
topic: Interpreting genotype notation tokens and connecting each token to a specific physical change in the DNA
question: |
  A genotype includes the token "delta(lac)X74". A student interprets
  this as meaning the lac operon is overexpressed because "delta" sounds
  like it could mean "enhanced."

  What does the delta symbol actually indicate in genotype notation,
  and what is the physical consequence?
choices:
  A: Delta means the gene is duplicated, so there are two copies of the lac operon
  B: Delta means a deletion — the lacX74 region has been physically removed from the chromosome, so the strain cannot metabolize lactose via that pathway
  C: Delta means the gene has been moved to a different chromosomal location
  D: Delta means the gene is under a different promoter than the wild-type version
answer: B
explanation: |
  In standard genotype notation, the Greek letter delta (or the word
  "delta") denotes a deletion. delta(lac)X74 means a specific deletion
  (designated X74) has removed part of the lac operon from the chromosome.
  The physical consequence is that the deleted DNA is gone — the strain
  lacks the corresponding gene products. This is important for blue-white
  screening strains where the chromosomal lacZ is deleted and complemented
  by a partial copy on a plasmid. Option A invents a meaning for delta.
  Option C describes a translocation, not a deletion. Option D describes
  a promoter swap, which would use different notation.

slug: context-changes-design-outcomes
difficulty: medium
topic: Reasoning about why the same genetic part produces different results in different genomic contexts
question: |
  A researcher characterizes a promoter-RBS-GFP cassette on a high-copy
  plasmid (~100 copies per cell) in E. coli strain DH10B and measures
  strong fluorescence. They then integrate the identical cassette as a
  single chromosomal copy in the same strain. Fluorescence drops by
  roughly 100-fold.

  What is the best explanation?
choices:
  A: The chromosomal DNA polymerase introduces mutations into the GFP gene during integration
  B: Gene expression is proportional to gene copy number — a single chromosomal copy produces far less total mRNA and protein than ~100 plasmid copies
  C: Chromosomal DNA cannot be transcribed by RNA polymerase
  D: The promoter only functions when it is on a circular plasmid, not on a linear chromosome
answer: B
explanation: |
  Expression output depends on context, and gene copy number is a major
  contextual variable. A high-copy plasmid provides roughly 100 templates
  for transcription per cell, while a single chromosomal insertion provides
  only one. With proportionally less mRNA produced, protein levels drop
  accordingly. This illustrates why Composition (which does not specify
  copy number or location) is distinct from genotype — the same gene
  in a different context produces a very different phenotype. Option A
  is unlikely for a standard integration method. Option C is false —
  chromosomal genes are transcribed normally. Option D is false — promoters
  function regardless of DNA topology.

slug: dna-string-vs-composition-information
difficulty: medium
topic: Identifying what semantic information is lost when a biological design is reduced to a raw sequence string
question: |
  A collaborator sends you a 3,000 bp DNA string with no other annotation.
  You know it encodes a gene, but you don't know what organism it came from
  or how it should be used. Compared to receiving a Composition object that
  specifies "Host: E. coli, Protein: LuxA", what information are you
  missing from the raw DNA string alone?
choices:
  A: Nothing is missing — the DNA string contains all necessary information because you can derive the protein from the sequence
  B: You are missing the host organism, the intended protein identity, and whether it should be on a plasmid or chromosome — information a Composition explicitly provides or that a Composition paired with design context would supply
  C: You are missing only the host organism — the protein sequence can be derived by translating all six reading frames
  D: The DNA string actually contains more information than the Composition because it specifies codon usage and regulatory elements
answer: B
explanation: |
  A raw DNA string lacks semantic context. You cannot determine from the
  sequence alone which organism it was designed for, what protein it is
  intended to encode (without knowing the correct reading frame and start
  site), or where it belongs in a build plan. A Composition provides the
  host and target protein identities explicitly. Conversely, option D is
  partially true — the DNA does encode codon choices and regulatory
  elements that Composition leaves open — but the question asks what you
  are *missing*, and the answer is the higher-level intent and context.
  Option A is wrong because translating a sequence requires knowing where
  the CDS starts. Option C understates the problem — even finding the
  right ORF among six frames requires additional context.
