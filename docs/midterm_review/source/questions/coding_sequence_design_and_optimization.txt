topic: Understanding why a mapping from output to input has many solutions while the reverse does not
question: |
  The genetic code maps 61 sense codons to 20 amino acids. A protein of
  100 amino acids must be reverse-translated into a DNA coding sequence.
  Why does this problem have many valid solutions while translation
  (DNA → protein) does not?
choices:
  A: Most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons (degeneracy), so each position has several choices; in translation, each codon maps to exactly one amino acid
  B: DNA polymerase can introduce random mutations during replication
  C: The genetic code is ambiguous — some codons encode multiple amino acids
  D: Reverse translation always produces a single unique answer because organisms use preferred codons
answer: A
explanation: |
  The genetic code is degenerate but unambiguous: multiple codons can
  encode the same amino acid, but each codon encodes exactly one amino
  acid. When going from protein to DNA, each amino acid position offers
  between 1 (Met, Trp) and 6 (Leu, Ser, Arg) codon choices, creating a
  combinatorial explosion. A 100-amino-acid protein could have roughly
  3^100 to 6^100 valid encodings. Option B is about replication errors,
  not the design problem. Option C is false — the code is unambiguous.
  Option D incorrectly claims there is one answer.

difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing why the simplest solution to a design problem is often insufficient
question: |
  The 'one amino acid–one codon' strategy assigns the most frequent codon
  for each amino acid and concatenates them. A designer uses this approach
  for the peptide <pre>MKKK</pre>. The result is <pre>ATG AAA AAA AAA</pre>.

  What fabrication problem does this create?
choices:
  A: The poly-A run (AAAAAAAAA) is a homopolymeric forbidden sequence that can cause synthesis errors and replication slippage
  B: The sequence has too high GC content for synthesis
  C: Three consecutive lysines are toxic to E. coli
  D: The codon AAA is rare in E. coli and will cause low expression
answer: A
explanation: |
  When the same codon is repeated for consecutive identical amino acids,
  it creates homopolymeric runs. AAAAAAAAA (9 A's) exceeds the typical
  8-base threshold for forbidden homopolymeric sequences. These runs cause
  problems during DNA synthesis (oligo-based assembly) and in vivo
  (polymerase slippage). The fix is to alternate between synonymous codons
  (e.g. AAA and AAG for lysine). Option B is wrong — poly-A is low GC.
  Option C — lysine runs are not inherently toxic. Option D — AAA is
  actually the most common lysine codon in E. coli.

slug: guided-random-codon-selection
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how weighted random sampling produces solutions biased toward desired properties
question: |
  The guided random method of codon optimization creates a list of 100
  entries for each amino acid, where each codon appears a number of times
  proportional to its usage frequency. For leucine:

  <pre>CTG: 49 entries, TTA: 13, TTG: 13, CTT: 11, CTC: 10, CTA: 4</pre>

  A random integer from 0–99 selects a codon. What is true about this
  approach?
choices:
  A: Frequently used codons are chosen more often, but rare codons still appear occasionally, producing diverse solutions
  B: CTG is always chosen because it has the most entries
  C: Each codon is chosen with equal probability regardless of the frequency table
  D: The method guarantees that no forbidden sequences will appear in the result
answer: A
explanation: |
  The integer-based lookup table implements weighted random selection.
  CTG has a 49% chance of being chosen for each leucine position, but
  TTA has a 13% chance, and even CTA has a 4% chance. Across a full
  gene, this produces sequences that statistically reflect the organism's
  codon bias while introducing diversity. Option B is wrong — selection
  is probabilistic, not deterministic. Option C ignores the weighting.
  Option D is wrong — forbidden sequences can still arise by chance and
  must be checked separately.

slug: cai-measures-codon-bias
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding what a summary metric captures about a sequence relative to a reference
question: |
  The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for a gene is calculated as the
  geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness (w) values for all its
  codons. A gene with CAI = 0.85 uses codons that are mostly preferred
  in the reference organism. What does a CAI of 0.15 indicate?
choices:
  A: The gene predominantly uses rare codons relative to the reference organism's highly expressed genes
  B: The gene has 15% GC content
  C: Only 15% of the gene's codons are valid
  D: The gene encodes a protein that is 15% identical to the reference organism's proteome
answer: A
explanation: |
  CAI ranges from 0 to 1 and measures how well a gene's codon usage
  matches the codon preferences of highly expressed genes in the host.
  High CAI means the gene uses preferred codons; low CAI means it uses
  rare codons that may slow translation. CAI is about codon choice, not
  GC content (B), codon validity (C), or protein similarity (D). A
  low-CAI gene may still produce functional protein but at reduced
  efficiency.

slug: restriction-site-removal-preserves-protein
difficulty: medium
topic: Making a constrained change that preserves one property while fixing a violation of another
question: |
  A coding sequence contains the BsaI site <pre>GGTCTC</pre> starting at position
  120. The overlapping codons at that position are <pre>GGT</pre> (Gly) and <pre>CTC</pre>
  (Leu). To remove the BsaI site without changing the protein, the
  designer should:
choices:
  A: Change GGT to GGC (still Gly) or CTC to CTG (still Leu), breaking the GGTCTC recognition sequence
  B: Delete the six bases GGTCTC and shift the reading frame
  C: Insert a stop codon before position 120 to prevent the enzyme from reaching the site
  D: Change GGT to AAA (Lys), which will reliably break the restriction site
answer: A
explanation: |
  Synonymous codon substitution changes the DNA sequence while preserving
  the encoded amino acid. Changing GGT→GGC changes the third position of
  the glycine codon (Gly is encoded by GGN), which breaks the GGTCTC
  recognition pattern. Similarly, CTC→CTG still encodes leucine but
  disrupts the site. Option B would destroy the protein by causing a
  frameshift. Option C would truncate the protein. Option D changes the
  amino acid from Gly to Lys, altering the protein.

slug: multiple-competing-objectives
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that optimization across multiple criteria involves tradeoffs, not a single best answer
question: |
  A codon optimization tool must simultaneously maximize CAI, avoid
  forbidden sequences (e.g. BsaI sites), minimize secondary structure
  near the start codon, and avoid homopolymeric runs. Why is there
  generally no single "best" coding sequence?
choices:
  A: Improving one objective (e.g. high CAI) can worsen another (e.g. creating homopolymeric runs), so the solution is a tradeoff
  B: The genetic code is too simple to encode all constraints
  C: There is always exactly one optimal solution but it is too expensive to compute
  D: Codon optimization does not actually affect expression, so all solutions are equivalent
answer: A
explanation: |
  The highest-CAI solution uses the most frequent codon for each amino
  acid, but this can create homopolymeric runs (like AAA AAA AAA for
  consecutive lysines) or accidentally introduce restriction sites.
  Fixing those issues requires using less-preferred codons, lowering CAI.
  This is a multi-objective optimization problem where the designer must
  balance competing constraints. Option C is wrong — there is no single
  optimum. Option D is contradicted by the 250-fold expression range
  observed in codon-variant GFP studies.

difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing between a per-element metric and a per-collection summary metric
question: |
  RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) and CAI (Codon Adaptation Index)
  both relate to codon usage bias. What is the key difference between them?
choices:
  A: RSCU describes the usage frequency of a single codon relative to its synonymous codons; CAI summarizes the overall codon adaptation of an entire gene
  B: RSCU applies to RNA while CAI applies to DNA
  C: RSCU is calculated from protein sequences while CAI is calculated from DNA
  D: RSCU and CAI are identical metrics expressed in different units
answer: A
explanation: |
  RSCU is a per-codon metric: it tells you how much more (or less)
  frequently a specific codon is used compared to equal usage of all
  synonymous codons. A value of 1.0 means average usage; above 1.0 means
  preferred. CAI is a per-gene metric: it computes the geometric mean of
  the relative adaptiveness values for all codons in a coding sequence,
  yielding a single number between 0 and 1. RSCU describes the reference
  set; CAI scores a specific gene against that reference.

slug: secondary-structure-affects-expression
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how a local structural property of a molecule affects a global functional outcome
question: |
  Two coding sequences encode the same protein but differ in codon usage.
  Sequence A has strong predicted secondary structure in the first 40
  nucleotides, while Sequence B has weak structure in the same region.
  Based on the Plotkin GFP study, what is the expected difference?
choices:
  A: Sequence B will likely have higher protein expression because weak structure near the start codon allows ribosome access
  B: Sequence A will have higher expression because secondary structure stabilizes the mRNA
  C: Both will have identical expression because they encode the same protein
  D: Sequence A will have higher expression because strong structure increases transcription rate
answer: A
explanation: |
  The Plotkin study demonstrated that secondary structure in the region
  from approximately -4 to +37 relative to the start codon is a major
  determinant of expression. Strong structure in this region occludes the
  ribosome's path and reduces translation initiation. Weak structure
  allows the ribosome to access the start codon and begin translating
  efficiently. Option B confuses stabilization of mRNA (not relevant at
  the 5' end in this way). Option C ignores the well-documented codon
  effect. Option D confuses translation with transcription.

slug: codon-context-matters
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding why adjacent elements interact to produce emergent effects not predicted by individual properties
question: |
  Research shows that the identity of adjacent codons (codon context or
  codon pairs) affects translation elongation rate beyond what individual
  codon frequency predicts. A codon context (CC) optimization approach
  gave better expression than individual codon usage (ICU) optimization.

  What does this imply for algorithm design?
choices:
  A: An optimization algorithm should evaluate codons in windows that include neighbors, not just one codon at a time
  B: Only the first codon after ATG matters for expression
  C: Codon optimization is unnecessary because context effects dominate
  D: The algorithm should use the rarest codons to maximize context diversity
answer: A
explanation: |
  If adjacent codon pairs affect expression beyond what single-codon
  frequency predicts, then evaluating each position independently (as in
  one-aa-one-codon) misses important interactions. Sliding-window
  approaches that score windows of 2–3 codons together can capture these
  effects. Option B is too narrow — context effects occur throughout the
  gene. Option C is a non-sequitur — both individual and context effects
  matter. Option D contradicts the goal of using well-adapted codons.

slug: iterative-generation-and-checking
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding a generate-and-test loop as a strategy when constraints cannot all be satisfied analytically
question: |
  A guided-random codon optimization algorithm works as follows:
  1. For each amino acid, randomly select a codon weighted by frequency
  2. Check the full sequence against all constraints (forbidden sequences,
     homopolymeric runs, etc.)
  3. If any check fails, go to step 1 and regenerate

  What is a practical risk of this approach?
choices:
  A: For proteins with many consecutive identical amino acids (e.g. MKKKKKKK), the loop may iterate many times before finding a valid sequence
  B: The algorithm will always produce the same sequence regardless of the random seed
  C: The algorithm cannot check for forbidden sequences because the sequence changes each iteration
  D: Guided random selection always produces invalid sequences
answer: A
explanation: |
  For peptides with runs of identical amino acids (like poly-lysine), the
  most frequent codon (AAA) is selected most often, creating
  homopolymeric runs that fail the forbidden sequence check. The algorithm
  must then regenerate, but the same bias applies each time. While it will
  eventually find a solution (using alternate codons like AAG), it may
  require many iterations. In extreme cases, this can appear to loop
  indefinitely. Option B is wrong — different random seeds produce
  different results. Option C is wrong — the check happens on each
  complete sequence. Option D overstates the problem.
