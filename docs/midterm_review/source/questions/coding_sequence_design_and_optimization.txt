topic: Understanding why reverse translation has many valid DNA solutions while translation is unambiguous
question: |
  The genetic code maps 61 sense codons to 20 amino acids. A protein of 100
  amino acids must be reverse-translated into a DNA coding sequence.

  Why does this design problem have many valid solutions, while translation
  (DNA → protein) does not?
choices:
  A: Most amino acids have multiple synonymous codons, so reverse translation offers multiple choices at many positions; in translation, each codon maps to one amino acid
  B: DNA polymerase introduces random mutations during replication, creating many possible outputs
  C: The genetic code is ambiguous, so some codons encode multiple amino acids
  D: Reverse translation produces a single unique sequence because organisms always use one preferred codon per amino acid
answer: A
explanation: |
  The genetic code is degenerate but unambiguous. Degenerate means multiple
  codons can encode the same amino acid. Unambiguous means each codon maps to
  exactly one amino acid. Therefore, reverse translation (protein → DNA) usually
  has many valid encodings, while translation (DNA → protein) does not.

  Option B is about replication errors, not reverse-translation design. Option C
  is false because codons do not encode multiple amino acids. Option D is false
  because codon preference does not eliminate synonymous alternatives.

difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing why a naive codon assignment strategy can fail fabrication constraints
question: |
  A "one amino acid, one codon" strategy assigns the most frequent codon for each
  amino acid and concatenates them. A designer applies this to the peptide
  <pre>MKKK</pre> and gets <pre>ATG AAA AAA AAA</pre>.

  What fabrication problem can this create?
choices:
  A: It creates a long poly-A run that can trigger homopolymer-related synthesis errors and polymerase slippage
  B: It creates excessively high GC content, which blocks synthesis
  C: Three consecutive lysines are inherently toxic to E. coli
  D: AAA is a rare lysine codon in E. coli, so expression will fail
answer: A
explanation: |
  Repeating the same synonymous codon for repeated amino acids can create long
  homopolymeric runs. In this case, repeated <pre>AAA</pre> codons generate a long
  run of A bases, which can cause synthesis and replication problems.

  A common fix is to alternate synonymous codons (for lysine, <pre>AAA</pre> and
  <pre>AAG</pre>) while preserving the protein sequence. Option B is incorrect
  because a poly-A run is low GC. Option C is false. Option D is false because
  <pre>AAA</pre> is not a rare lysine codon in E. coli.

slug: guided-random-codon-selection
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how weighted random codon selection biases solutions while preserving diversity
question: |
  A guided-random codon optimization method builds a 100-entry lookup table for
  each amino acid, with codons repeated in proportion to usage frequency. For
  leucine, the table is:

  <pre>CTG: 49 entries, TTA: 13, TTG: 13, CTT: 11, CTC: 10, CTA: 4</pre>

  A random integer from 0 to 99 selects one entry. What is true about this
  approach?
choices:
  A: Frequently used codons are selected more often, but less frequent codons still appear sometimes, so multiple valid sequences can be generated
  B: CTG is always selected because it has the highest count in the table
  C: All leucine codons are selected with equal probability because the selection is random
  D: The frequency-weighted selection guarantees that no forbidden sequences appear in the final gene
answer: A
explanation: |
  The lookup table implements weighted random sampling. Codons with more entries
  are selected more often, but lower-frequency codons still have nonzero
  probability and therefore still appear. This preserves host-biased codon usage
  while generating diverse sequence solutions.

  Option B is false because the method is probabilistic, not deterministic.
  Option C ignores the weighting. Option D is false because forbidden sequences
  can still arise by chance and must be checked separately.

slug: cai-measures-codon-bias
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding what CAI measures about codon usage relative to a reference set
question: |
  The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is a per-gene metric derived from codon
  adaptiveness values based on a reference organism's highly expressed genes. A
  gene with CAI = 0.85 mostly uses preferred codons.

  What does a CAI of 0.15 indicate?
choices:
  A: The gene mainly uses codons that are relatively rare in the reference organism's highly expressed genes
  B: The gene has 15% GC content
  C: Only 15% of the codons in the gene are valid codons
  D: The encoded protein is 15% identical to proteins in the host organism
answer: A
explanation: |
  CAI measures how well a gene's codon usage matches the codon preferences of a
  reference set (typically highly expressed host genes). A low CAI means the gene
  uses codons that are less preferred in that reference context.

  CAI does not measure GC content (B), codon validity (C), or protein-sequence
  similarity (D).

slug: restriction-site-removal-preserves-protein
difficulty: medium
topic: Making a synonymous DNA change that fixes a sequence constraint while preserving protein sequence
question: |
  A coding sequence contains a BsaI site <pre>GGTCTC</pre> starting at position 120.
  The overlapping codons are <pre>GGT</pre> (Gly) and <pre>CTC</pre> (Leu).

  To remove the BsaI site without changing the encoded protein, the designer
  should:
choices:
  A: Replace <pre>GGT</pre> with <pre>GGC</pre> (still Gly) or replace <pre>CTC</pre> with <pre>CTG</pre> (still Leu), disrupting the recognition sequence
  B: Delete the six bases <pre>GGTCTC</pre>, even though this shifts the reading frame
  C: Insert a stop codon before position 120 so the enzyme cannot reach the site
  D: Replace <pre>GGT</pre> with <pre>AAA</pre> to ensure the restriction site is broken
answer: A
explanation: |
  The correct strategy is a synonymous substitution: change the DNA sequence
  while preserving the amino acid sequence. Glycine and leucine each have
  multiple codons, so the BsaI recognition sequence can be disrupted without
  changing the protein.

  Option B causes a frameshift. Option C truncates the protein. Option D changes
  glycine to lysine and therefore changes the protein sequence.

slug: multiple-competing-objectives
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that coding-sequence optimization is a multi-objective tradeoff problem
question: |
  A codon optimization tool must balance several goals at once: maximize CAI,
  avoid forbidden sequences (for example, BsaI sites), reduce problematic local
  secondary structure near the start codon, and avoid homopolymeric runs.

  Why is there generally no single universally best coding sequence?
choices:
  A: Improving one objective can worsen another, so acceptable solutions represent tradeoffs among competing constraints
  B: The genetic code is too simple to represent all design constraints
  C: There is always exactly one true optimum sequence, but it is too expensive to compute
  D: Codon choice does not affect expression, so all synonymous solutions are equivalent
answer: A
explanation: |
  Coding-sequence design is usually a multi-objective optimization problem. For
  example, maximizing preferred codons can increase CAI but may also create
  homopolymer runs or introduce forbidden motifs. Fixing one issue may worsen a
  different score.

  The result is typically a set of tradeoff solutions rather than one universally
  best sequence. Option B is false. Option C incorrectly assumes a single global
  best answer in practice. Option D is contradicted by known expression
  differences among synonymous variants.

slug: rscu-vs-cai-distinction
difficulty: medium
topic: Distinguishing a per-codon usage metric from a per-gene codon adaptation metric
question: |
  RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) and CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) both
  relate to codon usage bias.

  What is the key difference between them?
choices:
  A: RSCU describes how often one codon is used relative to its synonymous alternatives, while CAI summarizes codon adaptation across an entire gene
  B: RSCU applies only to RNA sequences, while CAI applies only to DNA sequences
  C: RSCU is calculated from protein sequences, while CAI is calculated from DNA sequences
  D: RSCU and CAI are the same metric reported in different units
answer: A
explanation: |
  RSCU is a codon-level statistic that compares observed use of one synonymous
  codon to equal-use expectation. CAI is a gene-level summary score that combines
  codon adaptiveness values across a coding sequence.

  So RSCU helps define codon preference in a reference set, while CAI scores how
  well one gene matches that preference pattern. Options B, C, and D are
  incorrect.

slug: secondary-structure-affects-expression
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding how synonymous codon choices can change expression through local RNA structure near the start region
question: |
  Two coding sequences encode the same protein but differ in synonymous codon
  usage. Sequence A is predicted to form strong secondary structure in the first
  ~40 nucleotides of the coding region, while Sequence B has weaker structure in
  that region.

  Based on expression studies of synonymous GFP variants, what is the most likely
  outcome?
choices:
  A: Sequence B will likely express more protein because weaker structure near the start region improves ribosome access and initiation
  B: Sequence A will likely express more protein because stronger secondary structure always improves mRNA stability and translation
  C: Both sequences will express identically because they encode the same protein sequence
  D: Sequence A will likely express more protein because coding-region structure directly increases transcription initiation rate
answer: A
explanation: |
  Synonymous codon changes can alter local RNA structure near the translation
  start region. Strong structure in this region can reduce access to the RBS and
  start codon and lower translation initiation efficiency. Weaker local structure
  often supports higher expression.

  Option B overgeneralizes mRNA stability and ignores the specific importance of
  start-region accessibility. Option C ignores well-established synonymous-codon
  effects on expression. Option D confuses translation-related effects with
  transcription initiation.

slug: codon-context-matters
difficulty: medium
topic: Recognizing that codon context effects require algorithms to consider neighboring codons
question: |
  Research shows that adjacent codons (codon context or codon pairs) can affect
  translation elongation beyond what single-codon frequency predicts. In one
  comparison, codon-context-aware optimization outperformed optimization based
  only on individual codon usage.

  What does this imply for algorithm design?
choices:
  A: The algorithm should score codons in windows that include neighboring codons, not just optimize one position independently at a time
  B: Only the first codon after the start codon matters for expression
  C: Codon optimization should be abandoned because context effects make single-codon usage irrelevant
  D: The algorithm should prefer the rarest codons to maximize sequence diversity
answer: A
explanation: |
  If neighboring codons influence translation performance, then optimizing each
  codon independently misses important interactions. A context-aware algorithm
  should evaluate windows (for example, codon pairs or short local segments)
  rather than only single positions.

  Option B is too narrow. Option C is incorrect because both single-codon bias
  and context effects can matter. Option D is unrelated to the stated evidence.

slug: iterative-generation-and-checking
difficulty: medium
topic: Understanding the strengths and risks of generate-and-test optimization under multiple constraints
question: |
  A guided-random codon optimization algorithm uses this loop:

  <pre>
  1. Randomly choose codons (weighted by usage) for each amino acid
  2. Check the full sequence against constraints (forbidden motifs, homopolymers, etc.)
  3. If any check fails, regenerate and try again
  </pre>

  What is a practical risk of this approach?
choices:
  A: For proteins with repeated amino acids (for example, many lysines in a row), the algorithm may need many retries before it finds a sequence that passes all constraints
  B: The algorithm always returns the same sequence regardless of random seed
  C: The algorithm cannot check constraints because the sequence changes every iteration
  D: Weighted random codon selection always generates invalid sequences
answer: A
explanation: |
  Weighted random selection can repeatedly favor common codons that create the
  same constraint violations, especially in repeated-amino-acid regions (for
  example, repeated lysine codons creating homopolymer-prone runs). The algorithm
  may therefore require many generate-and-test cycles before finding an
  acceptable sequence.

  Option B is false because different random seeds can produce different
  sequences. Option C is false because constraint checking is performed on each
  generated full sequence. Option D overstates the problem.
