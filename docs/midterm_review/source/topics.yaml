          Reading stack traces to find where and why code failed. Includes raising
          exceptions intentionally for illegal inputs, writing clear error messages,

        scope: |
          Writing tests that define correctness and prevent regressions. Includes pytest
          structure, assertions, fixtures, validated example tests, edge cases (such as
          case normalization), truisms (property checks), and using inverse functions or
          simulators for validation.

  modeling_and_tools:
    title: Modeling and tools
    subtopics:
      schemas_identity_and_serialization:
        title: Schemas, identity, and serialization
        scope: |
          Defining what fields exist, what must always be true, and how objects are
          referenced. Includes required vs optional fields, invariants and validators,
          stable IDs and registries (reference-by-identifier), and representations that
          can be saved and reloaded without losing meaning.
      api_contracts_and_mcp:
        title: API contracts and MCP tool boundaries
        scope: |
          Designing function signatures and return structures so callers know what is
          expected and guaranteed. Includes explicit error modes, separating pure
          computation from I/O and side effects, and MCP fundamentals (Resources, Tools,
          Prompts; host/client/server roles; tool invocation as a controlled action).

    title: Central dogma
    subtopics:
      dna_rna_protein_and_core_processes:
        title: DNA, RNA, protein, and the core information transformations
        scope: |
          What DNA, RNA, and proteins represent and what they are used for, plus the
          core transformations of replication, transcription, and translation. Includes
          template usage, directionality, and what is copied versus decoded.
      regulation_control_points:
        title: Regulation and control points
        scope: |
          Where regulation acts on the dogma. Includes promoter control, RNA processing
          and degradation, translation initiation, and protein turnover.

      genome_strain_and_chassis_constraints:
        title: Genome context, strain identity, and chassis constraints
        scope: |
          Genome/locus context as the backdrop for design and editing, and why context
          changes outcomes. Includes strain vs genotype vs phenotype, and how host
          compatibility and resource limits constrain designs.

      targeting_rules_and_design_logic:
        title: Targeting rules and design logic
        scope: |
          How PAM rules constrain where editing is possible and how candidate target
          sites are generated. Includes protospacers, strand orientation and reverse
          complements, and why indexing/strand mistakes break designs.

        scope: |
          Building physical DNA from a design. Includes PCR and primer constraints,

          recognizing tradeoffs rather than a single best answer.
      verification_strategies_and_failure_modes:
        title: Verification strategies and failure modes
        scope: |
          Confirming that built DNA matches the intended design and diagnosing failures.

          failure modes, and using checkers to enforce domain-specific constraints.
