On choosing questions for a subtopic

A subtopic defines a region of understanding — not a list of facts to recall. The 10 questions in a subtopic should tile that region: each one should probe a distinct facet of the understanding, and together they should leave no major gap. If you removed any one question, there should be some aspect of the subtopic that a student could completely misunderstand and still pass.

What makes a good question

A good question presents a realistic scenario — one the student might actually encounter in their work — and asks them to reason through it. The answer should follow from understanding the domain logic, not from memorizing syntax or recalling a specific fact.

The test is: could you swap out the specific biological object or code construct for a different one of the same kind, and the question would still make sense and test the same skill? If yes, the question is probing understanding. If swapping the example breaks it — because the answer depended on remembering that specific thing — it's probing recall.

Distractors should represent genuine misconceptions, not random wrong answers. Each wrong choice should be the answer a student would pick if they held a specific, identifiable misunderstanding. A distractor that nobody would ever choose adds nothing.

The topic field should name the transferable reasoning skill, not the specific scenario. "Modeling a biological object as a data structure and making domain inferences from it" — not "checking whether Mach1 has AmpR resistance using a set." The topic is what you'd test again on the exam with a different scenario; the question is just one instance of it.

Finally: the question should sit at the intersection of at least two things the student has to understand. The best questions in this set require both a Python concept and a biological concept to answer correctly. Neither alone is sufficient. That intersection is where real understanding lives.
