This document will focus on **ApE, Benchling, and Biopython**, providing tutorials on how to get started and perform essential sequence operations.

## Ontology of Operations
- **_Search_**: Finding specific sequences or patterns within a larger sequence. Refer back to the tutorials for practical examples.
- **_Copy_**: Duplicating a sequence or a portion of it for further use.
- **_Reverse Complement_**: Generating the reverse complement of a DNA sequence.
- **_Translate_**: Converting a nucleotide sequence into its corresponding protein sequence using the genetic code.
- **_Annotate_**: Adding biological information to a sequence, such as gene names or functional regions.
- **_Digest_**: Cutting a DNA sequence at specific sites using restriction enzymes.
- **_Rotate_**: Shifting the sequence in a circular manner.
- **Feature Management**: The process of importing and managing custom features in tools like ApE and Benchling.

## Autoannotation in Biopython
Biopython does not have built-in autoannotation capabilities but allows users to create custom functions for this purpose.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.SeqFeature import SeqFeature, FeatureLocation

def autoannotate(sequence, feature_library):
    """
    Annotates a DNA sequence based on a provided feature library file.

    Parameters:
    - sequence (str): The DNA sequence to annotate.
    - feature_library (str): Path to the feature library file (.txt or .tsv) containing feature names and sequences.

    Returns:
    - list of SeqFeature objects representing the annotations with feature names and positions.
    
    Notes:
    - Ensure the feature library is formatted correctly with each line containing a feature name and sequence separated by a tab.
    - Users can modify the script to handle different input formats by adjusting the parsing logic as needed.
    """
    annotations = []
    with open(feature_library, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if line.startswith("#") or not line.strip():
                continue
            parts = line.strip().split("\t")
            if len(parts) < 2:
                continue
            feature_name, feature_seq = parts[0], parts[1]
            start_idx = sequence.find(feature_seq)
            if start_idx != -1:
                annotations.append(SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(start_idx, start_idx + len(feature_seq)), type="misc_feature", qualifiers={"label": feature_name}))
    
    return annotations

# Example usage
dna_seq = "ATGGCGGCTAGCGTACGTAGCAGTGCAGTCGATGCGATCG"
features = autoannotate(dna_seq, "default_features.txt")
for f in features:
    print(f"Feature: {f.qualifiers['label'][0]}, Location: {f.location}")
```

## Autoannotation in Benchling
- Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Feature Libraries**.
- Click **Upload Feature Library**.
- Provide a `.csv` file where **column 1** is the feature name and **column 2** is the feature sequence. Ensure there are no extra spaces or formatting issues that could cause import errors.
- Use `default_features.txt` for your feature file as a reference for formatting.
- Save the library and use the **Auto-annotate** feature on a new sequence to apply the annotations.
