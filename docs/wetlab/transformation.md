# Transformation

After assembly, the circular plasmid has been generated, but it is mixed with other DNAs‚Äîsome incomplete or mutant. By passing the material through cells, we isolate a single one of these sequences and amplify it a billion-fold.

**Transformation** is the process in which a bacterium takes up DNA from the environment. While some bacteria (like *B. subtilis*) do this naturally, *E. coli* requires preparation to become ‚Äúcompetent.‚Äù

There are two common methods:

---

### üîå Electroporation

Electroporation involves preparing cells in salt-free, ice-cold water or 10% glycerol and shocking them with a brief electric pulse in a special cuvette. This creates pores in the membrane, allowing DNA to enter. It is:

- ~100√ó more efficient than heat shock
- More expensive (cuvettes are single-use)
- Sensitive to salt contamination
- Ideal for library transformations needing high colony counts

---

### üå°Ô∏è Heat Shock (used in pP6)

We use the **TSS method** for heat shock, where cells are suspended in a PEG-salt mix. You add DNA and a small amount of KCM buffer, chill, then heat shock at 42¬∞C for 90 seconds.  
üìÑ [Full TSS protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/tss-competent-cells-and-transformation-csnqwddw.html)

TSS cells can be frozen in aliquots and remain competent for years. TSS cells are easier to work with during transformation and are well-suited for routine cloning workflows.

In dilute conditions, as in pP6, most cells take up just **one plasmid**, resulting in unique colonies.

---

### Rescue Step?

Some antibiotics (e.g., kanamycin, chloramphenicol) block translation immediately. To survive, cells must first express the resistance gene‚Äîthis requires a **rescue step** (1 hour outgrowth in rich media before plating).

**Ampicillin**, used in pP6, is different: it kills only **actively growing cells**. Cells recover naturally after transformation, so **no rescue is required**.

---

### Amp vs. Carbenicillin

Both are Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. The **bla** gene on pP6 confers resistance to both.

- Ampicillin breaks down when heated (e.g., during plate pouring)
- Carbenicillin is more stable, so we use **Carb** in practice

Cells without plasmid die at 5 ¬µg/mL; with plasmid, they survive over 1000 ¬µg/mL‚Äîa wide window for selection.

### Transformation Efficiency

Transformation efficiency measures how effectively DNA is taken up and expressed by cells. It's typically calculated as:  
**CFU/¬µg DNA = (Colonies on plate) √∑ (amount of plasmid DNA in ¬µg)**  
Our heat shock competent cells typically yield around **10‚Å∂ CFU/¬µg DNA**. With electroporation, efficiencies as high as **10¬π¬π CFU/¬µg DNA** can be achieved.  

This varies based on:

- Method (electroporation ‚â´ heat shock)
- Competency of the cells
- DNA purity and volume
- Handling technique

Don‚Äôt worry about calculating it for pP6, but understand that **low DNA input typically gives 1 DNA per cell**, which is ideal when selecting single clones.

---

### Handling Competent Cells

Competent cells are fragile. To maintain their viability:

- **Keep them cold at all times** (on ice or in a cold block).
- **Do not pipette vigorously.** Stir gently with the tip, then pipette up and down **once or twice carefully**.
- **Avoid bubbles**‚Äîthey indicate lysis.
- **Aliquot immediately after prep**‚Äîcells degrade with freeze-thaw cycles.
- **Do not re-freeze thawed competent cells**‚Äîeven one additional freeze-thaw cycle can dramatically reduce their transformation efficiency.

Note: You will not make your own competent cells. We prepare large batches once a year using the TSS method and store them at -80¬∞C. Your instructor or supervisor will provide a frozen aliquot when needed.

---

### Plating Techniques

Once transformation is complete, you‚Äôll plate your cells using one of two methods:

**1. Glass beads:**

- Pour the transformation mix onto the plate.
- Add ~5‚Äì10 sterile glass beads.
- Gently shake the plate in a circular motion (avoid sloshing).
- Pour off the beads into the discard jar.

**2. Metal spreader:**

- Use a **sterile spreader**. These can be disposable plastic, reusable metal or glass wands, or made by bending a glass pipette. We use bent coat hangers shaped into a triangle‚Äîthey cool quickly, are unbreakable, and can be reused indefinitely.
- Flame sterilize, cool briefly.
- Spread the liquid evenly by rotating the plate under the spreader.
- Don't gouge the agar.

Invert the plate (lid on the bottom) and place it in the incubator (not a shaker)

---

### Labeling and Inventory

Be consistent and thorough:

- Write **label, date, and your name** on the plate bottom (not the lid since those can fall off).
- Match plate name to your **sample ID and lab sheet** entry (e.g., `pP6-79`).
- Return any used DNA tubes to their storage rack and note usage if needed.
