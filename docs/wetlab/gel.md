# Gel Electrophoresis

After PCR, it‚Äôs important to confirm that the reaction worked by checking for the presence and size of the product. We do this by running a small portion of each PCR reaction on an **analytical agarose gel**.

## Why We Run a Gel

PCR can fail in a variety of ways (no product, wrong size, smearing, etc.). Running a gel lets us visually check:

- Whether a product was formed
- Whether it‚Äôs the correct size (~3583 bp for pP6)
- Whether there‚Äôs nonspecific amplification

This is an **analytical gel**, meaning we are only checking‚Äî**not purifying**‚Äîthe DNA.

## What Is a Gel?

Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. DNA is negatively charged and moves toward the red (positive) electrode when voltage is applied.

- **"Run to red"**: always load your DNA at the black (negative) electrode end.
- DNA travels through a gel matrix‚Äî**smaller pieces move faster**.
- A loading dye is added to weigh down the sample and track progress visually.

Gels are made from agarose, a gelling agent purified from seaweed. To prepare a gel, agarose is dissolved in 1√ó TAE buffer at 1% weight/volume by heating (typically in a microwave until boiling), then poured into a mold with combs to form wells. After it sets, we store the gels in bulk in a sealed container in the fridge. In lab, you‚Äôll cut a section from a pre-made gel with enough wells for your samples.

TAE stands for Tris-Acetate-EDTA. It is a buffer that maintains pH and ionic strength during electrophoresis. Standard 1√ó TAE contains 40 mM Tris, 20 mM Acetate, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.3.

## Lab Sheet Overview

**Title:** TPcon6-P6: Gel (79)  
**Location of PCR products:** Enzyme freezer, PCR rack labeled ‚Äúto Gel‚Äù

---

## Sample Setup

You‚Äôll set up one lane for each PCR product. In this case, you're preparing one labeled sample:

| Label | Size  | Product |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 79    | 3583  | P6      |

### To prepare your gel samples:
1. Add **8 ¬µL of loading dye** (tube labeled ‚Äòload‚Äô) to a new PCR tube.
2. Add **3 ¬µL of PCR product** to the tube, mix, and quick spin.

### Marker Sample (1 per section):
3. Add **8 ¬µL of loading dye** to a tube of marker (yellow), mix, and spin.

## Running the Gel

If others in your lab section are also ready to run a gel, set up one gel for the group:
4. Cut a gel slab with enough wells for all samples plus 1 for marker and a few extras.
5. Place the gel in the rig. Fill with **1√ó TAE buffer** to just cover it.
6. Brace the gel with a plastic wedge to keep it from floating.
7. Label all samples on a strip of paper and arrange tubes in loading order.
8. Using a P20 set to **9 ¬µL**, load each sample into a well carefully. Avoid puncturing the wells‚Äîif you do, restart that lane.

## Electrophoresis

9. Attach the lid and power leads: **"run to red"**.
10. Run at **175 volts for ~10 minutes**, or until the front (blue) dye band is 2/3‚Äì3/4 down the gel.

## Imaging the Gel

11. Transfer the gel to the imager and place a sample label strip above it.
12. Take a picture **with your phone through the orange filter**.
13. Name the image file by date and time (e.g., `2022_05_23-10am.png`) and upload it to:
